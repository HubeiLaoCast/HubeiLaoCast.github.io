## Preface

### The Feasibility of Self-Help

First, let's imagine an ideal scenario: everyone could use technologies like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor their own corresponding brain activity in real-time while engaged in a specific psychological activity. By comparing this to the brain activity of an average person in a similar situation, we could assess our own mental health status and be guided in making adjustments.

Although the aforementioned scenario is not realistic, subjectively, different brain activities correspond to different phenomenological experiences and cognitive schemas. Due to various factors, even when in similar situations, the experiences produced by the same subject at different times may vary in quality. Therefore, differences in brain activity patterns can be self-assessed through these qualitative differences in phenomenological experience. Although individuals with Asperger's Syndrome and survivors of Complex PTSD (hereafter "survivors," where no ambiguity arises) have their own limitations, they still possess a considerable degree of social function. They are capable of making relatively objective self-assessments through observation and learning, especially learning within social activities.

Compared to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex PTSD (CPTSD) has a more complex pathology. However, the traumatic events associated with it are often relatively milder, making it easier for the subject to bear the various painful emotions aroused during the process of dealing with the trauma.

The aforementioned conditions make self-help healing possible.

### The Necessity of Self-Help

Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and Complex PTSD (CPTSD) share a considerable degree of commonality. The focus of this article is on helping the subject achieve transformation, with no intention of making a clear distinction between the two. In fact, the distinction between them is highly subjective: if treatment methods for survivors are effective for individuals with Asperger's Syndrome, people will assume the previous diagnosis was incorrect ; if all treatment methods are ineffective for a survivor, people will suspect that the survivor is actually an individual with Asperger's Syndrome. The richness of their connotations and the diversity and complexity of their manifestations make modern medical interventions feel like "scratching an itch through a boot," finding it difficult to be effective. Meanwhile, related psychological counseling methods generally involve long cycles, high costs, and poor outcomes. Even if they are effective, due to the generally lagging mental development of survivors, transferring the therapeutic gains from the counseling relationship to real-life situations poses a problem. For individuals with Asperger's and survivors who have already reached adulthood, self-help is almost the only reliable means.


The resolution of psychological disorders needs to rely on good social relationships, but survivors and individuals with Asperger's Syndrome often severely lack the ability to develop meaningful relationships with others. If they are forcibly pushed into various complex social environments (similar to the approach of exposure therapy), it is not only unhelpful for growth but may also cause secondary harm. In reality, the early stages of self-healing can be conducted perfectly well in relatively simple social settings or even in peaceful solitude. Only after some stubborn, foundational problems have been addressed can social-level support fully play its role. This article focuses on the methods for addressing these foundational issues.

###  Basic Approach

For survivors who are still young, treatment must begin with rebuilding attachment relationships. This requires the joint participation of the person concerned, their caregivers, and professionals, which is beyond the scope of this article. This article primarily serves survivors who have already stumbled into adulthood.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) holds an absolutely dominant position in the field of PTSD treatment. Among its approaches, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PET) are the most widely used. However, when CBT is applied to CPTSD, the results are less than satisfactory.

Trauma treatment techniques that focus on somatic experience (躯体体验) evolved from Gestalt Therapy. Among these, Peter Levine's Somatic Experiencing (SE) approach is the most well-known. CBT starts from cognitive schemas and behavioral habits to drive a shift in mind-body state. But CPTSD requires more complex and subtle processing, needing many special conceptual tools and practical techniques. Somatic Experiencing, which uses somatic experience as its entry point, happens to compensate for the shortcomings of CBT. From the perspective of CBT, Somatic Experiencing operates much like a specially packaged version of CPT and PET. It is centered on the specific case, paying full attention to subtle, hard-to-express details with great patience and focus.

What this article focuses on is precisely this supplementary role that Somatic Experiencing plays in relation to CBT.

In China, CBT and psychodynamics are relatively popular, while Somatic Experiencing has a comparatively weaker public foundation. Therefore, this article will dedicate more space to introducing concepts and ideas related to Somatic Experiencing, and will not elaborate on CBT and psychodynamics. Relevant materials can be found in the recommended bibliography at the end of the text.

Similar to fever and coughing, "ADHD" and "Asperger's Syndrome" are crude clusters of symptoms rather than standardized pathological labels. This article, based on the positive psychology view of difference (see section 1.4) and the Somatic Experiencing view of the mind-body (see section 1.5), understands the essence of ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome as a kind of "vulnerability". Due to severe disturbances in the early developmental process, the subject is in a "vulnerable state" right at life's starting point. This state makes them extremely susceptible to various injuries during their early explorations; even their own body can be a source of trauma (see section 3.10). The traumatization (创伤化) process for an individual with Asperger's Syndrome begins in early childhood, or even earlier, and after long-term progression and compensation, it forms a tangled, complex, and chaotic presentation. The self-help treatment for Asperger's Syndrome should be built upon the foundation of self-help for CPTSD. Compared to the "neurodiversity paradigm" and the "pathology paradigm," this article's understanding of Asperger's Syndrome can be summarized as the "social relations paradigm".

Where no ambiguity arises, this article will refer to psychological trauma simply as "trauma". However, as we will soon see, psychological trauma and physical trauma share a significant common origin. A vulnerable psyche and a vulnerable body are twin brothers.

This article is neither a nanny-style tutorial nor a dictionary-style manual. It is merely a sharing by the author based on their own knowledge reserve and personal experience. It is hoped that it can bring some help to those in need, and also that it may allow ordinary people to get a glimpse into the phenomenological world (sometimes called "subjective reality") of trauma survivors, thereby fostering a bit more understanding and tolerance.

### Reading Tips

The main text is approximately 140,000 words long, divided into seven chapters. To keep the writing concise, this article will not elaborate on concepts (such as the definitions of stress disorders, CPTSD, etc.) or cases that are already explained in detail in the must-read bibliography at the end. This may pose a certain reading difficulty for readers lacking a psychology background or those with attention deficits due to severe traumatization. This difficulty is, in a sense, necessary and can be understood as a challenge intentionally set by the author. These must-read materials (see sections 7.1-7.6) are by no means optional embellishments for this article. If you can't get through those materials, this article will probably not suit you either. Among them, the two marked with a ★ are the direct sources of this article's ideas; without them, this article would not exist.

CPTSD is different from PTSD. For PTSD survivors, the content of this article may be overly tedious and of limited significance.

Self-rescue from CPTSD is a serious, lengthy, and extremely challenging task. Knowledge reserves, life experience, learning ability, patience, determination, and insight are all indispensable. Only those who firmly believe they possess these abilities can save themselves. The journey of transcending trauma is like a rebirth, and many people will gain a higher state of mind as a result; as the saying goes, no effort is in vain (功不唐捐). This article is not suitable for those seeking a quick fix or for those who are merely troubled by everyday trifles.

The article's content includes hypothetical components, and chapters with significant hypothetical elements will be specially noted. The ultimate criterion for testing truth is practice, not authority. A diagnosis that cannot offer a solution is of little meaning to the person concerned. Regarding the scientific nature of psychotherapy theories, the person concerned and the researcher have an equal right to speak; the relationship between them is one of equal cooperation.

This article is an original work by **[光瞳](https://www.zhihu.com/people/alexcma)**, here it is a polished English translation version of his remarkable article.

## Chapter 1: The Foundation: Understanding the Self and Trauma

### The View of Human Nature

This article does not discuss antisocial personality.

Prosociality is a human instinct. The reason ordinary people prefer socializing is not that their prosocial instinct is stronger, but because they have accumulated a wealth of positive interactive experiences in life. If a person has never established a meaningful emotional connection with others, they cannot know what loneliness is, let alone actively resist it. However, this does not mean they are unaffected by loneliness. For example, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (or other pervasive developmental disorders) commonly have issues such as autonomic nervous system disorders, low immunity, abnormal arousal levels, and difficulty regulating attention. To a large extent, these problems are caused by long-term loneliness.

The goal of psychotherapy is to allow the subject's own nature to fully unfold, not to pursue some "ideal personality". If a subject's ability to express love is limited, it is only because they have been very deeply hurt.

### The View of Responsibility (Self-Responsibility, Struggle, Protracted Struggle)

#### The Spirit of Self-Responsibility

Trauma and deficits are not one's own fault, but one must take ultimate responsibility for one's own rescue. Only by seeing one's own responsibility clearly can one see the agency and influence one possesses. "Taking responsibility for oneself" is absolutely not "victim-blaming". Responsibility never means "taking the blame" or even being humiliated.

Although the misfortunes of many survivors are related to physiological deficits, family of origin, or upbringing, these factors all belong to life's "initial settings". The first step in walking out of the shadow of trauma is to reconcile with one's initial settings. Reconciliation is not forgiveness, and certainly not settling scores; it is about truly seeing the complete picture of growth. Only those who can comprehend this point have the possibility of achieving self-rescue.

Cultivating the spirit of self-responsibility first requires completing the identity shift from "victim" to "survivor". This means shifting the core focus from "what injuries I have suffered" to "how I have managed to persist to this day" and "what more I can do".

The healing process will arouse a great deal of anger. Survivors must remember the principle of "hating the act, not the person". Both forgiveness and settling scores are irrelevant to healing; they are matters to be re-evaluated by the subject with their full cognitive abilities 

after healing is complete. Feeling anger is for the purpose of reclaiming the inner strength we have abandoned, not for attributing the cause of our lost strength to deprivation by others. Attributing the cause to others is equivalent to admitting that others can control our healing process, which is undoubtedly a self-defeating act.

#### The Spirit of All-Out Struggle

If we compare trauma to a wound on a tree, then CPTSD is like the dead branches and fallen leaves scattered after the wounded tree has fallen. The treatment process for CPTSD is neither a simple process of dressing the wound nor a simple process of cleaning up debris; it is the process of growing a new, great tree upon the remnants. Survivors must discard the fantasy of "patching things up to last another three years" and be prepared for a complete, radical transformation (lit. "shedding one's skin and bones"). Only when survivors recognize that they have no further retreat, that all means of escape have utterly failed, can they move toward awakening. Otherwise, they can easily fall into self-pity during the self-rescue process.

#### The Spirit of Protracted Struggle

The extremeness of a reaction is always closely linked to the isolation of the event. When facing a problem, if a person believes they will never encounter it a second time, they will likely either go all-in and overdraw their resources, or do nothing at all, simply closing their eyes and praying for it to pass. But if they believe this problem will become a frequent visitor, and that if they ignore it, they will face more and more restrictions, they will adopt a completely different attitude. People who are able to walk out of the shadow of trauma understand the weight of the words "to maneuver" (周旋) far better than ordinary people.

The self-rescue from CPTSD is a spiral-up process; it cannot be accomplished overnight. Each new cycle in the process requires bearing greater pressure than the last, but simultaneously, there are more resources available. After the cycle ends, the subject will also reap more vitality and a more profound peace. In the course of this cycling, the subject's mind and body, starting from a heap of fragments, gradually form larger pieces, and finally merge into a unified whole.

Each cycle is a process of "getting it" (开窍), "awakening," or "ascending a dimension". It completes naturally after the subject's most authentic life force is released. Psychotherapy is to help us unfold our nature, find confidence in the "flow" (流畅感) of life, not to make us overly cautious.


#### The Spirit of Self-Forgetfulness (Selflessness)

The solution to a problem is never found where the problem was formed. People who keep staring at their own trauma and deficits will only sink deeper and deeper into them. Finding one's spiritual anchor and life's pursuit, and in the process of that pursuit, establishing and developing emotional connections with others, is the necessary path for personality development.

The process of personality development is the process of the subject walking out of the self and towards others. The process of walking towards others is, in turn, the process of perfecting the self and learning to be alone. This sounds contradictory, yet this contradiction is the essential difference between life and inanimate objects. Being able to appreciate the common essence behind the contradiction, reaching a state of "wanting to explain, but having already forgotten the words" (欲辨已忘言), is often the starting point of awakening.

For more content on the spirit of self-forgetfulness, see section 4.10 "External Investment".

### The Social Relations Paradigm (Nature vs. Nurture)

#### View of Nature vs. Nurture

The human as a biological organism and the human as a social individual do not exist on the same level. This viewpoint can be understood through the analogy of the relationship between a "software system" and a "hardware system" in computer science: early computer systems did not deliberately distinguish between "software" and "hardware". As computer systems became increasingly complex, people began to describe them from the two dimensions of "hardware" and "software". Although the software system is based on the hardware system, their conceptual systems and terminologies are mutually independent; the software system cannot be simply reduced to the hardware system. A computer's operational process can be described from both the hardware process and the software process angles, and both descriptions are self-consistent. The two do not have a simple correspondence in structure, and one cannot logically impose causality between them. Their relationship is complex, not linear. Similarly, the concepts used to describe human activity (especially social activity) cannot be in simple correspondence with the anatomical structures or material components of the human body (including the brain).

For example, people once thought the brain's occipital lobe was responsible for visual function. But as technology advanced, it was discovered that the occipital lobes of blind individuals are also highly active, so the understanding of the occipital lobe was upgraded to being responsible for spatial recognition function. Later, it was found that the occipital lobe alone cannot form a complete spatial perception ability, nor does it only function during the process of spatial recognition. Today, scientists' understanding of the brain has developed to a very abstract level, and a series of unique conceptual systems, detached from everyday language, is being formed.

But we need not feel pressured by this. Just as a computer software engineer does not need to know the infinite details of the hardware's working processes, nor will they rashly demand hardware system changes due to their own lack of ability. We do not need to learn endless neurobiology or neurochemistry to understand and process our own trauma. This is not very meaningful for self-help, and pharmacological or physical interventions often carry risks. Researchers rigidly differentiate "innate factors" and "acquired factors," "internal factors" and "external factors," primarily to achieve a delineation of responsibility, to clearly define the boundaries of "non-intervenable" vs. "intervenable" and "physiochemical intervention" vs. "cognitive intervention," in order to answer the question, "Can we intervene, and who will intervene?". The answer to this question is of vital interest to the researcher (the observer), but it is of almost no value to the person concerned.

Suppose we compare the physiological basis of a psychological disorder to a "chicken," and the abnormal cognitive schemas and behavioral habits to an "egg" (this analogy is used considering that a chicken laying an egg is easier than an egg producing a chicken). In that case, the formation process of the psychological disorder is a chicken-and-egg, egg-and-chicken process that continues until the chicken coop is packed to bursting. The primary goal of intervention is to break this cycle, not to worry about whether there were initially more eggs or more chickens. From the subject's own perspective, the formation of any psychological disorder is the result of both innate and acquired factors acting together. Emotional intelligence is like a muscle: it is both innate and trained; it is developed subconsciously in various activities, and it can also be developed through conscious exercise. The discussion of nature versus nurture has limited meaning in self-help treatment.

#### The Social Relations Model and the Neurophysiological Model

The essence of psychological problems is various forms of "alienation". Psychological problems can only be most comprehensively understood and most accurately intervened with within a social relations framework. The observation, understanding, and intervention of psychological problems depend on the most subtle details within specific interactions. Psychological problems are the internalization of social relations problems. Differences at the neurophysiological level do not directly determine an individual's differences in adaptive ability. Overly focusing on neurophysiological factors risks "mistaking the branch for the root" (舍本逐末). Discussing the abstract nature of psychological problems detached from the specific individual has limited meaning. Survivors should not use "innate factors cannot be changed" as an excuse to evade responsibility.

Psychological intervention models developed based on the social relations paradigm are all classified as social relations models. In contrast, intervention models that primarily attribute the causes of and interventions for psychological problems to neurophysiological factors belong to neurophysiological models. CBT is based on the social relations model; Somatic Experiencing and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy pursue the unification of the social relations model and the neurophysiological model. Given the current level of development in psychological intervention techniques, all effective intervention methods are inseparable from the social relations model. This article mainly uses the social relations paradigm to understand various psychological problems and will not involve much neurophysiological knowledge.

### The Positive Psychology and Spectrum View (Moving Beyond Labels)

This article views the difference between individuals with psychological disorders and ordinary people through the lens of Positive Psychology's view on difference. This view of difference can be summarized as the "View of 'Mostly the Same, Slightly Different'" and the "Spectrum View," with the former being the foundation for the latter.

#### View of "Mostly the Same, Slightly Different" 

Humans possess both consistency and diversity, with consistency holding the dominant position. This is why humanity can possess rich possibilities while existing as a whole. Significant consistency often contains subtle differences, and significant differences often contain broad consistency. No matter how much we focus on the differences between those with psychological disorders and ordinary people, these differences and divisions are secondary and minor. The commonalities and connections between people are what is universal and primary; it is only that people, out of a desire for the novel (or the bizarre), prefer to focus on that small difference.

#### The Spectrum View 

The spectrum view opposes labeling.

The so-called "normal" and "abnormal" are merely opposing labels that people, out of laziness, forcibly apply to the same presentation existing at different degrees. For example, Social Darwinists simplistically divide humanity into the strong and the weak, defining social relations as "competition," and from that point on, they never again have to concern themselves with human diversity or the complexity of social activities. A valuable description should be capable of covering all phenomena on the same spectrum, from the typical to the atypical or from the general to the specific, rather than describing them separately and then adding extra explanations of their connections, which only creates artificial divisions.

For example, this article explains the survivor's atypical mind-body state as the individual's "habitual state" deviating significantly from the recognized "optimal state". Ordinary people also experience various deviations, but these deviations are not significant and can be adjusted or compensated for unconsciously without consuming extra cognitive resources or producing obvious discomfort. As another example, many CPTSD survivors are accustomed to dividing consciousness objects into "inner objects" and "outer objects," which displays a certain sense of fragmentation (splitting). But even so, their primary experience of the world remains the same as that of ordinary people. Even ordinary people sometimes identify with this division, because they also experience these states of consciousness, it just doesn't cause them significant maladaptation. For the convenience of expression, this article will sometimes use "inner" and "outer" to differentiate things, but this must be viewed from the stance of the spectrum view.

Compulsive behaviors and reflexive behaviors can also be seen as existing on the same spectrum; the only difference is that the activation conditions for the former are relatively stringent and thus more easily noticed and regulated. Conditioned reflexes, unconditioned reflexes, and operant (instrumental) conditioned reflexes can also be seen as being on the same spectrum. A conditioned reflex is formed by serialized behaviors using unconditioned reflexes as core components, combined with matching elements; a conditioned reflex that includes significant operational behavior is an operant conditioned reflex; an operant conditioned reflex that has developed into a hard connection through long evolution is an unconditioned reflex.

#### Diagnostic Labels from the Spectrum View 

An appropriate label can transform originally indescribable suffering into a shareable meaning. The subject can use this as a starting point to search for relevant resources and strive to change their situation; this is the true meaning of a label. A label should be understood as an "index," not an "identity".

The reality, however, is that labels often cause people to be "labeled". Some people are marginalized because of a label and subjected to various forms of "special treatment"; many parents lose all confidence in their child simply because the child has been labeled "Asperger's". Some people, because of a label, persistently seek out so-called "their own kind" to seek psychological comfort. The person becomes alienated into an appendage of the label and thus loses the possibility of change.

If a certain characteristic of a person is too prominent, they can easily see others with similar characteristics as their own kind, completely ignoring other, more fundamental and important qualities. Children are often keen to find an identity; once they are labeled "Asperger's," they are more likely to gravitate toward other people with special labels, which undoubtedly introduces new risks to their development.

#### Self-Help from the Spectrum View 

Psychological self-help is not about acting as one's own counselor; that is completely unrealistic.

The social environment is full of various potential sources of trauma; our immunity and self-healing ability determine the impact they have on us. From this perspective, it seems survivors should learn from those with strong immunity and self-healing abilities. Regrettably, however, the phenomenological world of these "strong" people differs too greatly from the survivor's phenomenological world to be adequately expressed within the same discourse system. Ordinary people cannot understand why survivors are so fragile , and survivors cannot understand how ordinary people manage to use trauma to achieve growth. The value of a self-help theory lies in constructing a scientific discourse system capable of encompassing the phenomenological worlds of both the survivor and the ordinary person. On one hand, it allows survivors to experience the phenomenological world of ordinary people, understand their immunity and self-healing abilities, and thus clarify the direction and methods for their own efforts. On the other hand, it allows ordinary people to experience the phenomenological world of survivors, understand their vulnerability, and thus find it easier to get along with them.

Self-rescue is not about developing a series of special skills to compensate for one's deficits; it is about helping the survivor exercise the "psychological muscles" that have atrophied due to trauma. Take "mindfulness" as an example: people with outstanding emotional intelligence generally possess the ability to integrate their various feelings and avoid being swept away by a single, strong emotion, but they never emphasize this ability of theirs. In the eyes of a survivor, they seem to possess a sort of "divine power". By introducing the concept of "mindfulness," fully explaining its meaning, and demonstrating its various applications, we can help survivors cultivate this ability, thereby helping them achieve post-traumatic growth.

Compared to physiological deficits, psychological disorders possess strong heterogeneity. It is less that people have difficulty finding the physiological basis for psychological disorders, and more that psychological disorders may fundamentally lack a 

common physiological basis. The "pathology" of every person concerned may be unique. This is one reason the "pathology paradigm" is so controversial. Psychological disorders require individualized intervention plans, and developing such plans is impossible without a discourse system capable of communicating between different phenomenological worlds. It is like learning to drive: one must first recognize the brake, accelerator, etc. Forcing onto the road without understanding these basic configurations will only cause a traffic accident.

Life is full of dark humor. Sometimes a simple problem can trap a person for a lifetime. Many psychological dilemmas seem unsolvable simply because they are difficult to express adequately within existing discourse systems. Since it cannot be clearly stated, the person concerned can only resign themselves to fate, attributing the problem to some "innate defect". An appropriate discourse system capable of bridging the phenomenological worlds of the ordinary person and the person with a disorder can help us locate our own coordinates on a sufficiently broad and detailed map, thereby finding the way home. As a valuable self-help theory, its language must be able to function as a "signpost," "bridge," and "translator". A theory that cannot point the way for those who are trapped is merely a decorative vase, no matter how exquisite.

The best candidates for this work are those who have lived in two (or more) completely different phenomenological worlds and who possess a certain degree of academic literacy and expressive ability. In human history, the "border people" who traveled between different communities often became the earliest "translators," making significant contributions to the spread and development of civilization.

The author of this article has had the fortune of shuttling between the phenomenological worlds of the CPTSD survivor and the ordinary person. May this article serve as a catalyst (lit. "toss a brick to attract jade") to awaken more attention to the phenomenological world of the survivor.

### The Integrated Mind-Body View (The Core Somatic Model)

#### The Integrated Body-Brain View 

Somatic Experiencing does not deliberately distinguish between brain activity and body activity. Any specific activity simultaneously involves the activities of various body parts, including the brain. The activity of the brain can be indirectly observed through the body's micro-activities. The "body (physical)" mentioned in this article always includes the brain.

Even a paramecium, a protozoan, clearly displays in its daily activities a certain quality unique to living organisms. When we observe the life of a paramecium, we unconsciously experience emotions similar to those we feel when observing higher animals. This emotion cannot be explained by "projection," because we rarely have this feeling no matter how complex the mechanical motion we observe. This article does not intend to explore the essence of life, but merely uses this as an entry point to the hierarchical model of the mind commonly used in modern psychotherapy.

From the limbs to the brain, from the brain's lower cortex to the higher cortex, it is not a case of the former being subordinate to the latter, or the lower serving the higher. On the contrary, the former is the premise, foundation, source, and destination of the latter; the latter is the enhancement, extension, and integration of the former. The latter comes from the former and returns to the former, enabling the former to be integrated at a higher level. Making the energy flow of the former more efficient and smooth, thereby unleashing higher creativity, is the meaning of the latter's existence. This view of the body-brain relationship can be called the "Integrated Body-Brain View". It unifies the evolutionary history of the species with the developmental process of the individual, and unifies low-level instinctive activities with high-level cognitive activities. It allows us to understand the underlying logic of higher animal life activities by observing the life activities of lower animals, to understand the inner driving force of adult activities by observing children's activities, and to understand what is happening in the brain through the explicit information displayed by bodily activity.

"Instinct," "Emotion," and "Cognition" are all products of body-brain integration, with the degree of integration increasing sequentially. In everyday context, people often use "body" to refer to instinct. "Integration" (整合) is a slightly awkward term; emotion and cognition cannot be simply reduced to physiological activity, so terms like "integration" or "emergence" must be used to vaguely express the mind-body relationship. Although integration is abstract, "plucking up courage" (鼓起勇气) is familiar to everyone; the process of plucking up courage is a kind of spontaneous integration. All self-help strategies are ultimately aimed at helping the subject "pluck up courage" in the most natural way.

#### The Integrated Mind-Body View 

Behavior is the integrated result of instinct, emotion, and cognition.

The relationship among instinct ("Body" or "Reptilian Brain"), emotion ("Mind" or "Lower Mammalian Brain"), and cognition ("Intellect" or "New Brain") can be compared to the body-brain relationship described above. This mind-body view can be called the "Integrated Mind-Body View". It unifies the evolutionary history of the species, the developmental process of the individual, and the specific behavioral process, possessing extremely strong explanatory and guiding significance. It allows us to use the language of the body and life (the explicit information displayed by the body and life) to tell the story of the psyche (the phenomenological world). The "Body" is both the real body and the so-called "subconscious"; it is directly unified with the external environment. Body and Mind constitute the "Child Self"; Body, Mind, and Intellect together constitute the "Adult Self".

[Image: Diagram from source 132 showing Body/Mind/Intellect levels] 


(Labels on diagram: Intellect, Mind, Body. Right labels: Emotion & Cognition; Emotion; Stress. Arrows show loops from external Object up through levels and back down.) 

The diagram above can be compared to the neural reflexes in defecation. Body, Mind, and Intellect can be sequentially compared to lower and higher central nervous centers.

#### Two Kinds of Growth 

The Child Self is the foundation of the Adult Self, therefore we can also use children's activities to understand the underlying logic of adult activities. Our various presentations in childhood did not simply disappear or change with age; on the contrary, they became the foundation for more complex behaviors and cognitive processes. When we encounter extreme situations where these complex processes all fail, forcing us to start processing the problem again from a very basic level, our childhood behavioral styles will clearly manifest, and even flashes of childhood scenes may appear in our minds. This phenomenon is known in psychodynamics as "regression".

Growth is both a continuous process of reshaping basic sequenced behaviors and cognitive schemas, and a process of developing more complex habits and cognitive schemas. The former is the first type of growth; the latter is the second type of growth. The first type of growth usually occurs when the individual's practical activity ability far exceeds their cognitive ability, characterized significantly by "acting first and knowing later". The growth discussed by adults is mainly the second type of growth; "the unity of knowing and acting" is the basic requirement of the second type of growth. For ordinary people, the first type of growth is basically completed in late adolescence. Its adaptive significance is to enable the subject to face the various impacts of social reality with a relatively independent stance, thereby allowing the second type of growth to reach a very high level. For survivors, the first type of growth is never completed. This both allows their personality to exhibit good plasticity even in adulthood, and also makes their second type of growth extremely unstable. The vast majority of a survivor's abnormal presentations can be seen as the product of severely insufficient Type 1 growth and excessive compensation by Type 2 growth.

The transformation of impulse into action usually follows two paths: the "Impulse 

→ Action → Observation and Experience → Improved Action" path (Type 1 Growth), and the "Impulse → Self-Inhibition → Analysis and Thought → Action" path (Type 2 Growth). The former is the premise and foundation of the latter; the latter is the supplement and extension of the former. The former can be compared to a child acquiring their mother tongue; the latter to an ordinary person acquiring a foreign language. (This analogy is somewhat crude, as learning clearly does not equal growth. Growth implies an evolution from simple to complex, from potential to reality, from changeable to stable.) . The more complete the Type 1 growth, the greater the space for Type 2 growth, and the greater the individual's "potential". If survivors wish to develop their capacity for action, they must, through hard practice, make up for the Type 1 growth that was left behind.

#### The Synergy of Body, Mind, and Intellect 

A vibrant body cannot nurture a depressed heart. The synergy of Body, Mind, and Intellect was expressed by Peter Levine as "Three Brains, One Mind". When this synergy is subjected to intense disturbances that exceed self-regulatory capacity, psychological problems appear.

Synergy can be divided into two opposing aspects, coordination and complementarity, and also into two opposing directions, top-down and bottom-up. On a long-term level, the activity levels of the body, mind, and intellect remain consistent. But specific to a single moment, there will be repeated instances of one waning as the other waxes. In the instant we capture an abnormal scent in the environment, our limbs may freeze, but the brain becomes highly activated (manifesting as the sudden disappearance of large movements and a sudden increase in micro-activities, activating detailed and comprehensive observation). Then, the limbs become active again, and the brain calms slightly. This repeats many times until returning to a normal state. The degree of the brain's momentary activation reflects the individual's cognitive and mental resources. If the brain's activation is insufficient, the body will struggle to recover its vitality from the freeze state. Unless an appropriate external force intervenes, the individual will continue to appear "stunned". This is much like two people playing ping-pong: as long as one side fails to return the ball, the interaction halts, and both sides will freeze in place until someone picks up the ball. Through repeated matches, the skill levels of both sides will tend to converge.

Somatic Experiencing focuses on mind-body synergy; rebuilding the connection between body and intellect is a crucial component of SE. Cognitive therapy focuses on mind-intellect synergy; helping the individual establish a life narrative that fully reflects their own subjective reality is a crucial component of cognitive therapy.

#### The Two Dimensions of Traumatization 

In the context of this article, "integration" and "differentiation" are two sides of the same coin. "Insufficient integration" and "insufficient differentiation" have essentially the same meaning. The difference is that insufficient integration emphasizes the "fragmented state" caused by trauma, while insufficient differentiation emphasizes the "chaotic state" caused by developmental stagnation. Integration is tightly linked differentiation; differentiation is clarified integration. The antonyms for integration and differentiation are splitting and disintegration. The extreme form of splitting and disintegration is dissociative disorder.

The process of trauma healing is analogous to a team overcoming internal splitting tendencies and reforming its cohesion. Integration can be divided into two dimensions: "integration between levels" and "integration within the same level".

Insufficient integration between levels manifests as "having no backbone (lack of subjectivity)". The subject can only experience simple, intense emotions and make simple, crude stress responses, unable to form delicate, complex feelings and thoughts. They easily interpret social interaction as "acting" and "scheming".

Insufficient integration within a level manifests as "self-conflict," also known as "being twisted" (拧巴). The subject easily interprets social interaction as "gossip".

The higher the degree of integration within (between) levels, the more easily the problems of insufficient integration between (within) levels are exposed, and thus the more easily they are corrected in time. On a long-term level, the degree of integration within a level and the degree of integration between levels remain consistent.

Integration or disintegration between levels can be perceived through changes in the mind-body state; integration or disintegration within a level can be identified through self-coordination or self-conflict. Social situations (or other high-pressure situations) drive the subject to maintain a high degree of integration 

between levels; at this time, problems with insufficient integration within a level (self-conflict) are easily exposed, while problems with insufficient integration between levels are easily concealed. The situation in solitude is the reverse. For example, many CPTSD survivors feel completely normal when alone, but the moment they enter a social situation, they fall into sensory overload and feel completely at a loss. Many depressed individuals, when alone, fall into endless cognitive rumination, showing difficulty initiating actions, yet they feel much better when they are with friends. At that time, they will make many positive commitments to themselves. But the moment they return to solitude, they again fall into a state of depression from which they cannot escape.

#### Self-Help from the Integration View 

From the perspective of intersubjective relationships, the process of survivor self-rescue is the process of the adult individual using their "Adult Self" to take on the responsibility of the previously absent parent; under scientific guidance and within social life, they educate the neglected "Child Self," cultivating its ability to act and its capacity for self-restraint. From the perspective of the subject-environment relationship, self-rescue is the process of the subject resetting their own primal impulses. This reset of impulses is often accompanied by intense, involuntary trembling.

### The Core of Interaction: Understanding Interaction Loops

(Note: This section begins the conceptual analysis, which forms the logical start of the book's theoretical model.)

Interaction forms "loops" (交流圈). One party initiates an invitation, the other party responds; the response, in turn, drives the initiating party to change their state, and the states of both parties rapidly change, mutually causing one another. Within the continuous cycling of these interaction loops, impulses (in this article, "impulse" specifically refers to behavioral impulses), emotions, and concepts continuously emerge, develop, differentiate, and dissolve; the subject's adaptation to and modification of stimuli proceed synchronously.

In Raun K. Kaufman's family-internal treatment technique for autism, the interaction loop is an important foundational concept. This article uses this concept as its logical starting point, and all content throughout the text should be understood within the context of interaction loops.

Just as "symptoms" (discomfort perceived by the subject) and "signs" (abnormalities found by an observer) are different concepts, the interaction loop can also be described from two different perspectives.
