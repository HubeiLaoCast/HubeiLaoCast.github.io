## Our Podcasts

We currently offer two different audio versions based on the insightful work on CPTSD by **光瞳**.

### 1. CPTSD Healing (Summary)

This podcast is a **paraphrased summary** of the original work, generated with assistance from NotebookLM. It's a more concise listen, as many details are omitted. This podcast is in English, created for my own learning and for any friends in Tassie and beyond.
