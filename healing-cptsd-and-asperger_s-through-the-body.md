## Preface

### The Feasibility of Self-Help

First, let's imagine an ideal situation: everyone can use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and other technologies to monitor their corresponding brain activity in real-time while engaged in a specific psychological activity. By comparing this to the brain activity of an average person in a similar situation, we could assess our own psychological health and guide our own adjustments.

Although the above scenario is not realistic, subjectively, different brain activities correspond to different phenomenological experiences and cognitive schemas. Due to various factors, even in similar situations, the experiences produced by the same individual at different times can vary in quality. Therefore, differences in brain activity patterns can be self-assessed through differences in the quality of phenomenological experience. Although individuals with Asperger's Syndrome and Complex PTSD survivors (hereafter "survivors," provided it causes no ambiguity) have their own limitations, they still possess a considerable degree of social functioning. They have the ability to make relatively objective self-assessments through observation and learning, especially through learning in social activities.

Compared to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), although Complex PTSD (CPTSD) is more complex pathologically, the associated traumatic events are often relatively milder. It is easier for the individual to bear the various painful emotions aroused during the process of dealing with the trauma.

These conditions make self-help healing possible.

### The Necessity of Self-Help

Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and Complex PTSD (CPTSD) share a significant degree of commonality. This article focuses on helping the individual achieve transformation and does not intend to make a clear distinction between the two. In practice, the distinction between the two is highly subjective: if a treatment method for a survivor works for an individual with Asperger's, people will assume the previous diagnosis was incorrect; if all treatment methods fail for a survivor, people will suspect that the survivor is an individual with Asperger's. The richness of their connotations and the diversity and complexity of their manifestations make modern medical interventions feel like "scratching an itch from outside the boot," finding it difficult to be effective. Meanwhile, related psychological counseling methods generally involve long cycles, high costs, and poor results. Even if they are effective, the transfer of therapeutic effects gained from the counseling relationship to life situations is a problem, given that the mental development level of survivors is generally lagging. For adults with Asperger's Syndrome and survivors, self-help is almost the only reliable means.

The resolution of psychological disorders relies on good social relationships, but survivors and individuals with AS often severely lack the ability to develop meaningful relationships with others. If they are forcibly pushed into various complex social environments (similar to the approach of exposure therapy), it will not only be unhelpful for growth but may also cause secondary harm. In reality, the early stages of self-healing can be carried out in relatively simple social situations or even in peaceful solitude. Only after some stubborn, foundational problems have been addressed can social-level support fully play its role. This article focuses on methods for handling these foundational problems.

### The Basic Approach

For young survivors, treatment must begin with rebuilding attachment. This requires the joint participation of the person concerned, caregivers, and professionals, which is beyond the scope of this article. This article primarily serves survivors who have already stumbled into adulthood.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) holds an absolutely dominant position in the field of PTSD treatment. Among its methods, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PET) are the most widely used. However, when CBT is applied to CPTSD, the results are less than satisfactory.

Trauma treatment techniques that focus on somatic experience emerged from Gestalt Therapy. Among these, Peter Levine's Somatic Experiencing (SE) approach is the most well-known. CBT starts with cognitive schemas and behavioral habits to drive a shift in mind-body states. But CPTSD requires more complex and subtle processing, necessitating the use of many special conceptual tools and practical techniques. Somatic Experiencing, which enters through somatic experience, perfectly compensates for the shortcomings of CBT. From a CBT perspective, SE operates much like a specially packaged version of CPT and PET. It is centered on the specific case, fully attentive to subtle, hard-to-express details, and requires extreme patience and focus. This article is concerned precisely with this supplementary role that SE plays for CBT.

In China, CBT and psychodynamics are relatively popular, while the mass foundation for Somatic Experiencing is relatively weak. Therefore, this article will use more space to introduce concepts and ideas related to SE and will not dwell on CBT and psychodynamics; relevant materials can be obtained from the recommended book list at the end of the text.

Similar to fever and coughing, ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome are crude collections of symptoms rather than standardized pathological labels. This article, based on the positive psychology view of difference (see Section 1.4) and the SE view of the mind-body (see Section 1.5), understands the essence of ADHD and Asperger's as a "vulnerability." Due to severe disturbances in the early developmental process, the individual is in a "vulnerable state" from the very beginning of life. This state makes them extremely susceptible to various injuries during their early life explorations; their body itself may even be a source of trauma (see Section 3.10). The traumatization process for individuals with Asperger's begins in early childhood, or even earlier life stages. After long-term progression and compensation, it forms a complex and chaotic tangle of manifestations. Self-help for Asperger's should be based on self-help for CPTSD. Compared to the "neurodiversity paradigm" and the "pathology paradigm," this article's understanding of Asperger's can be summarized as the "social relations paradigm."

Provided it does not cause ambiguity, this article will refer to psychological trauma simply as trauma. But we will soon see that psychological trauma and physical trauma share a great deal of homology. A vulnerable psyche and a vulnerable body are twin brothers.

This article is neither a nanny-style tutorial nor a dictionary-style manual. It is merely a sharing of the author's own knowledge reserve and personal experience. It is hoped that it can bring some help to those in need, and also that it can offer ordinary people a glimpse into the phenomenological world (sometimes called "subjective reality") of trauma survivors, thereby fostering a bit more understanding and tolerance.

### A Note to the Listener

The main text is approximately 140,000 Chinese characters, divided into seven chapters. To keep the writing concise, this article will not elaborate on concepts (such as the definitions of stress disorders, CPTSD, etc.) or cases that are already explained in detail in the required reading list at the end of the text. This may create reading difficulty for readers lacking a foundation in psychology or those with attention deficits due to severe traumatization. This difficulty is, in a sense, necessary and can be understood as an intentional challenge set by the author. These required readings (see Sections 7.1-7.6) are by no means optional embellishments for this article. If you cannot get through this material, it is likely that this article will also not suit your taste. Among them, the two books marked with a ★ are the direct source of this article's ideas; without them, this article would not exist.

CPTSD is different from PTSD. For PTSD survivors, the content of this article may be overly tedious and of limited significance.

Self-rescue from CPTSD is a serious, lengthy, and extremely challenging task. Knowledge reserves, life experience, learning ability, patience, determination, and perceptiveness are all indispensable. Only those who firmly believe they possess these abilities can save themselves. The journey beyond trauma is like a rebirth; many people will gain a higher state of mind as a result. As the saying goes, no effort is ever in vain. This article is not suitable for those seeking a quick fix or for those who are merely troubled by daily trifles.

The content of the article contains hypothetical components; chapters with a larger hypothetical component will be specially noted. The ultimate standard for testing truth is practice, not authority. A diagnosis that cannot offer a solution is of little meaning to the person concerned. Regarding the scientific nature of psychotherapy theories, the person concerned and the researcher have an equal right to speak; the relationship between them is one of equal cooperation.

Except for quoted passages, this article is an original work. Please observe relevant norms when reprinting or citing.

## Chapter 1: The Foundation: Understanding the Self and Trauma

### The View of Human Nature

This article does not discuss antisocial personality.

Prosociality is a human instinct. The reason ordinary people prefer socializing is not that their prosocial instincts are stronger, but that they have accumulated abundant positive interactive experiences in life. If a person has never established a meaningful emotional connection with others, they cannot know what loneliness is, much less actively resist it. This does not mean, however, that they will not suffer its effects. For example, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (or other pervasive developmental disorders) commonly exhibit autonomic nervous system dysfunction, low immunity, abnormal arousal levels, and difficulty regulating attention. To a large extent, these problems are caused by long-term loneliness.

The goal of psychotherapy is to fully unfurl the individual's own nature, not to pursue some "ideal personality." If an individual's ability to express love is limited, it is only because they have been deeply hurt.

### The View of Responsibility (Self-Responsibility, Struggle, Protracted Struggle)

#### The Spirit of Self-Responsibility


Trauma and deficits are not one's own fault, but one must take ultimate responsibility for one's own rescue. Only by seeing one's own responsibility clearly can one see the agency and influence one possesses. "Taking responsibility for oneself" is absolutely not "blaming the victim." Responsibility absolutely does not mean "taking the blame" or being humiliated.

Although many survivors' misfortunes are related to physiological defects, family of origin, or their developmental environment, these factors all belong to life's "initial settings." The first step in walking out of trauma's shadow is to reconcile with one's "initial settings." Reconciliation is not forgiveness, and it is certainly not an indictment; it is truly seeing the complete picture of growth. Only those who can grasp this point can possibly achieve self-rescue.

Cultivating a spirit of self-responsibility first requires completing the identity shift from "victim" to "survivor." One must shift the core focus from "what injuries have I suffered?" to "how have I managed to endure until today?" and "what more can I do?"

The healing process will evoke a large amount of anger. Survivors must firmly remember the principle: "Hate the act, not the person." Both forgiveness and indictment are irrelevant to healing; they are matters to be re-evaluated by the individual, using their complete cognitive abilities, *after* healing is complete. We feel anger in order to reclaim the inner strength we abandoned, not to attribute the cause of our lost strength to others' deprivation. Attributing the cause to others is tantamount to admitting that others can control our healing process, which is undoubtedly a self-defeating act.

#### The Spirit of Total Struggle


If trauma is like a wound on a tree, CPTSD is the scattered dead branches and fallen leaves after the tree, covered in wounds, has fallen. The treatment process for CPTSD is neither a simple process of treating wounds nor a simple process of cleaning up trash; it is the process of growing a new, great tree upon the remains of the old trunk. Survivors must shed the illusion of "patching things up for another three years" and prepare for a total metamorphosis (shedding one's skin and changing one's bones). Only when survivors realize they have no path of retreat left, that all means of escape have thoroughly failed, can they move toward awakening. Otherwise, they can easily fall into self-pity during the self-rescue process.

#### The Spirit of Protracted Struggle


Extreme reactions are always closely linked to the isolation of an event. When facing trouble, if a person believes they will never encounter it a second time, they will likely either stake everything on one throw, overdrafting themselves, or do nothing at all, merely closing their eyes and praying it passes quickly. But if they believe this trouble will become a frequent visitor, and that ignoring it will subject them to more and more limitations, they will adopt a completely different attitude. Those who can walk out of the shadow of trauma understand the weight of the word "maneuver" (to deal with something tactfully, to circle around it) far better than ordinary people.

The self-rescue from CPTSD is a spiral upward; it cannot be accomplished overnight. Each new cycle in the process requires enduring greater pressure than the last, while simultaneously having more resources to utilize. After the cycle ends, the individual reaps more vitality and a more profound peace. During this cyclical process, the individual's mind and body, starting from scattered debris, gradually form larger fragments, and finally merge into a unified whole.

Each cycle is a process of "enlightenment," "awakening," or "ascending a dimension." It is completed naturally after the individual's truest life force is released. Psychotherapy exists to help us unfurl our natural disposition and rediscover confidence from the "sense of flow" in life, not to make us meticulously cautious.

### The Social Relations Paradigm (Nature vs. Nurture)

#### The Nature vs. Nurture View


The human as a biological organism and the human as a social individual are not on the same level. This concept can be understood through the relationship between "software systems" and "hardware systems" in computer science. Early computer systems did not deliberately distinguish "software" and "hardware." As systems grew more complex, people began describing them from these two dimensions. Although the software system is based on the hardware system, their conceptual systems and terminologies are independent. The software system cannot be simply reduced to the hardware system. A computer's operation process can be described from both the hardware perspective and the software perspective; both descriptions are self-consistent. The two cannot be simply mapped structurally, and we cannot logically force a causal relationship between them. The relationship between them is complex, not linear. Similarly, the concepts used to describe human capabilities (especially social capabilities) cannot be simply mapped to the anatomical structures or material components of the human body (including the brain).

For example, people once thought the brain's occipital lobe was responsible for visual function. But as technology advanced, it was discovered that the occipital lobes of blind individuals are also highly active, leading to the understanding that the occipital lobe is responsible for spatial recognition function. Later, it was found that the occipital lobe alone cannot form a complete spatial perception, nor does it only function during spatial recognition. Today, scientists' understanding of the brain has developed to a very abstract level, and a series of unique conceptual systems, detached from everyday language, is forming.

But we do not need to feel pressured by this. Just as a software engineer does not need to know the infinite details of the hardware's working processes, nor will they rashly demand hardware changes just because their own ability is insufficient, we do not need to learn endless neurobiology or neurochemistry to understand and process our trauma. This is of little significance to self-help, and pharmaceutical or physical interventions often carry risk. Researchers rigidly distinguish between "innate factors" and "postnatal factors," "endogenous factors" and "external factors," mainly to delineate responsibility—to clearly define the boundaries between "non-intervenable" and "intervenable," "physiochemical intervention" and "cognitive intervention," in order to answer the question: "Can it be intervened, and who intervenes?" The answer to this question concerns the vested interests of the researcher (the observer), but it holds almost no value for the person concerned.

If we compare the physiological basis of a psychological disorder to a hen, and the abnormal cognitive schemas and behavioral habits to an egg (this analogy is used considering it is easier for a hen to lay an egg than an egg to hatch a hen), then the formation of the disorder is the process of the hen laying the egg and the egg hatching the hen until the chicken coop is bursting. The primary goal of intervention is to break this cycle, not to worry about whether there were initially more eggs or more hens. From the individual's own perspective, the formation of any psychological disorder is the result of both innate and postnatal factors working together. Emotional intelligence, like muscle, is both innate and trained; it is developed subconsciously through various activities, and it can also be developed through conscious exercise. The discussion of nature versus nurture has limited significance in self-help healing.

#### The Social Relations Model and Neurophysiological Model


The essence of psychological problems is various forms of "alienation." Psychological problems can only be most comprehensively understood and accurately intervened with within a social relations framework. The observation, understanding, and intervention of psychological problems depend on the most subtle details within specific interactions. Psychological problems are the internalization of social relationship problems. Differences at the neurophysiological level do not directly determine differences in an individual's adaptive capacity. Over-focusing on neurophysiological factors risks mistaking the branch for the root. Discussing the abstract nature of psychological problems detached from the specific individual is of limited significance. Survivors should not use "innate traits cannot be changed" as an excuse to evade responsibility.

This passage concentrates the core thinking of the "social relations paradigm." Psychological intervention models developed based on this paradigm all belong to the social relations model. In contrast, intervention models that primarily attribute the cause and intervention methods of psychological problems to neurophysiological factors belong to the neurophysiological model. CBT is based on the social relations model. Somatic Experiencing and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy pursue a unification of the social relations model and the neurophysiological model. Given the current developmental level of psychological intervention techniques, all effective interventions are inseparable from the social relations model. This article primarily uses the social relations paradigm to understand various psychological problems and will not involve much neurophysiological knowledge.

### The Positive Psychology and Spectrum View (Moving Beyond Labels)

This article views the differences between individuals with psychological disorders and ordinary people through the lens of Positive Psychology's view of difference. This view can be summarized as the "View of Great Similarity, Minor Difference" and the "Spectrum View," with the former being the foundation for the latter.

#### The View of Great Similarity, Minor Difference


Humanity possesses both uniformity and diversity, with uniformity being the dominant factor. This is why humankind can possess rich possibilities yet still exist as a whole. Significant uniformity often contains subtle differences, and significant differences also contain widespread uniformity. No matter how much we focus on the differences between those with psychological disorders and ordinary people, these differences and divisions are secondary and subtle. The commonalities and connections between people are universal and primary; it is just that people, driven by a desire for novelty, are more willing to focus on that small point of difference.

#### The Spectrum View


The spectrum view opposes labeling.

So-called normal and abnormal are merely opposing labels that people forcibly apply to the same manifestation at different degrees, simply out of laziness. For instance, Social Darwinists simplistically divide humanity into the strong and the weak, defining social relations as "competition," and from then on, never need to concern themselves with human diversity or the complexity of social activities. A valuable description ought to be able to cover all phenomena within the same spectrum—from typical to atypical, or from general to specific—rather than describing them separately first and then adding extra explanations about their correlations, which only creates artificial divisions.

For example, this article interprets the survivor's abnormal mind-body state as the individual's "habitual state" significantly deviating from the recognized "optimal state." Ordinary people also have various deviations, but these deviations are not significant and can be adjusted or compensated for unconsciously without consuming extra cognitive resources, nor do they produce obvious discomfort. As another example, many CPTSD survivors are accustomed to dividing conscious objects into internal objects and external objects, which reveals a certain sense of fragmentation. But even so, their primary experience of the world is the same as that of ordinary people. Even ordinary people sometimes identify with this division, because they, too, experience these states of consciousness, it just doesn't cause them significant maladaptation. For convenience of expression, this article will sometimes use "internal" and "external" to distinguish things, but they must be viewed from the stance of the spectrum view.

Compulsive behaviors and reflexive behaviors can also be seen as existing on the same spectrum; the only difference is that the activation conditions underpinning the former are relatively strict and thus more easily perceived and regulated. Conditioned reflexes, unconditioned reflexes, and operant conditioning can also be seen as existing on the same spectrum. A conditioned reflex is a sequential behavior formed with an unconditioned reflex as its core component, combined with matching elements. A conditioned reflex that includes significant operational behavior is operant conditioning. Operant conditioning that has developed into a hard-wired connection over long-term evolution is an unconditioned reflex.

#### Diagnostic Labels from a Spectrum View


An appropriate label can turn indescribable suffering into a shareable meaning. The individual can use this as a starting point to seek relevant resources and strive to change their situation. This is the true meaning of a label. Labels should be understood as an "index," not an "identity."

The reality, however, is that labels often lead to people being "labeled." Some are marginalized because of a label, subjected to all kinds of "special treatment." Many parents completely lose faith in their children simply because they were labeled "Asperger's." Some people, because of a label, obsessively seek out so-called "kindred spirits" to find psychological comfort. The person becomes alienated, an appendage to the label, and thus loses the possibility of change.

If a person's traits in one area are too prominent, it is easy for them to see others with similar traits as being of the same kind, completely ignoring other, more fundamental and important qualities. Children are often keen on seeking identity confirmation. Once they are labeled "Asperger's," they are more likely to flock together with other people bearing special labels, which undoubtedly introduces new risks to their development.

#### Self-Help from a Spectrum View


Psychological self-help is not acting as one's own counselor; that is completely unrealistic.

The social environment is full of potential trauma sources. Our immunity and self-healing power determine the impact they have on us. From this perspective, it seems survivors should learn from those with strong immunity and self-healing abilities. Unfortunately, however, the phenomenological world of these "strong ones" is too different from that of survivors, so much so that it is difficult to express them appropriately within the same linguistic system. Ordinary people cannot understand why survivors are so fragile, and survivors cannot understand how ordinary people can use trauma to achieve growth.

The value of a self-help theory lies in constructing a scientific linguistic system that can encompass the phenomenological worlds of both survivors and ordinary people. On one hand, it allows survivors to experience the phenomenological world of ordinary people and understand their immunity and self-healing power, thereby clarifying the direction and methods for their own efforts. On the other hand, it allows ordinary people to experience the phenomenological world of survivors, understand their vulnerability, and thus find it easier to get along with them.

Self-rescue is not about developing a series of special skills to compensate for one's deficits; it is about helping the survivor exercise the "psychological muscles" that have atrophied due to trauma. Take "mindfulness" as an example. People with high emotional intelligence generally possess the ability to integrate their various feelings without being swept away by a single, intense emotion, but they never emphasize this ability of theirs. In the eyes of a survivor, they seem to possess a sort of "divine power." By introducing the concept of "mindfulness," fully explaining its meaning, and demonstrating its various applications, we can help survivors cultivate this ability, thereby helping them achieve post-traumatic growth.

Compared to physiological defects, psychological disorders have strong heterogeneity. Rather than saying it is difficult to find a common physiological basis for psychological disorders, it is better to say they have no common physiological basis at all. Each person's "pathology" may be unique. This is one reason the "pathology paradigm" is so controversial. Psychological disorders require individualized intervention plans. Devising individualized intervention plans requires a linguistic system capable of bridging different phenomenological worlds. It is like learning to drive a car: we must first recognize the brake, the accelerator, and so on. If we hit the road without knowing these basic configurations, we will only cause a traffic accident.

Life is full of dark humor. Sometimes a single, simple problem can trap a person for a lifetime. Many psychological dilemmas seem unsolvable only because they are difficult to articulate properly within existing linguistic systems. Since they cannot be clearly explained, the person concerned can only resign themselves to fate, attributing the problem to some "innate defect." An appropriate linguistic system—one that can bridge the phenomenological worlds of ordinary people and those with psychological disorders—can help us locate our coordinates on a sufficiently vast and detailed map, thereby finding the way home. As a valuable self-help theory, its language must function as a "signpost," a "bridge," and an "interpreter." A theory that cannot point the way for those who are trapped is just a decorative vase, no matter how exquisite.

The best candidates for this work are those who have lived in two (or more) completely different phenomenological worlds and who possess a certain degree of academic literacy and expressive ability. In human history, the "border people" who traveled between different communities often became the earliest "translators"; they made important contributions to the spread and development of civilization.

The author of this text has had the fortune of traveling back and forth between the phenomenological worlds of CPTSD survivors and ordinary people. May this article serve as a catalyst, awakening more people to the importance of the survivor's phenomenological world.

### The Integrated Mind-Body View (The Core Somatic Model)

#### The Integrated Body-Brain View


Somatic Experiencing does not intentionally distinguish between brain activity and body activity. Any specific activity simultaneously involves the activity of all parts of the body, including the brain. The brain's activity can be indirectly observed through the body's micro-activities. The "body (flesh)" mentioned in this article always includes the brain.

Even a protozoan like a paramecium clearly displays certain qualities unique to living organisms in its daily activities. When we observe the life of a paramecium, we unconsciously experience emotions similar to those we feel when observing higher animals. This emotion cannot be explained by "projection," because we rarely have this feeling no matter how complex the mechanical motion we observe. This article does not intend to explore the essence of life, but only to use this as an entry point into the hierarchical model of the mind commonly used in modern psychotherapy.

From the limbs to the brain, and from the brain's lower cortex to its higher cortex, it is not a case of the former being subordinate to the latter, or the lower serving the higher. On the contrary, the former is the premise, foundation, source, and destination of the latter. The latter is the enhancement, expansion, and integration of the former. The latter comes from the former and returns to the former; its reason for existence is to make the energy flow of the former more efficient and smooth, thereby unleashing higher creativity. This body-brain relationship view can be called the "Integrated Body-Brain View." It unifies the evolutionary history of the species with the developmental process of the individual, and unifies lower-level instinctive activities with higher-level cognitive activities. It allows us to understand the underlying logic of higher animal life activities by observing the life activities of lower animals; to understand the internal dynamics of adult activities by observing the activities of children; and to know what is happening in the brain through the explicit information displayed by bodily activity.

"Instinct," "emotion," and "cognition" are all products of body-brain integration, with the degree of integration increasing in that order. In daily context, people often use "body" to refer to instinct. "Integration" is a slightly awkward term; emotion and cognition cannot be simply reduced to physiological activity, so terms like "integration" and "emergence" must be used to vaguely express the mind-body relationship. Although integration is abstract, "plucking up courage" is familiar to everyone. The process of plucking up courage is a kind of spontaneous integration. All self-help strategies are ultimately aimed at helping the individual "pluck up courage" in the most natural way.

#### The Integrated Body-Mind View


Behavior is the integrated result of instinct, emotion, and cognition.

The relationship between instinct ("Body" or "Reptilian Brain"), emotion ("Mind" or "Lower Mammalian Brain"), and cognition ("Intellect" or "Neocortex") can be analogized to the body-brain relationship described above. This view of the psyche can be called the "Integrated Body-Mind View." It unifies the evolutionary history of the species, the developmental process of the individual, and the process of specific behaviors, giving it extremely strong explanatory and guiding significance. It allows us to use the language of the body and life (the explicit information displayed by the body and life) to tell the story of the psyche (the phenomenological world). The "Body" is both the physical body and the so-called "subconscious"; it is directly unified with the external environment. Body and Mind constitute the "Child Self"; Body, Mind, and Intellect together constitute the "Adult Self."

This model can be analogized to the neural reflexes involved in defecation. Body, Mind, and Intellect can be sequentially analogized to lower-level and higher-level central command centers.

#### Two Kinds of Growth


The Child Self is the foundation of the Adult Self; therefore, we can also use children's activities to understand the underlying logic of adult activities. Our various manifestations during childhood do not simply disappear or change with age; on the contrary, they become the foundation for more complex behaviors and cognitive processes. When we encounter extreme situations and all these complex behaviors and cognitive processes fail, we are forced to start processing problems again from a very basic level. At this time, our childhood behavioral style will clearly manifest, and even images from childhood may flash through our minds. This phenomenon is known in psychodynamics as "regression."

Growth is both a process of constantly reshaping basic sequential behaviors and cognitive schemas, and a process of developing more complex habits and cognitive schemas. The former is the **First Kind of Growth**, and the latter is the **Second Kind of Growth**. The First Kind of Growth usually occurs in a state where the individual's practical ability far exceeds their cognitive ability, characterized significantly by "action before knowing." The growth discussed by adults is mainly the Second Kind of Growth; "the unity of knowing and acting" is the basic requirement of the Second Kind of Growth. An ordinary person's First Kind of Growth is basically complete by late adolescence. Its adaptive significance is to enable the individual to face the various impacts of social reality from a relatively independent stance, allowing the Second Kind of Growth to reach a very high level. The survivor's First Kind of Growth was never completed. This both allows their personality to exhibit good plasticity even in adulthood and also makes their Second Kind of Growth extremely unstable. The vast majority of a survivor's abnormal manifestations can be seen as the product of severe deficiency in the First Kind of Growth and excessive compensation by the Second Kind of Growth.

The transformation of impulse into action usually follows two paths: the "Impulse -> Action -> Observation and Experience -> Improved Action" path, and the "Impulse -> Self-Inhibition -> Analysis and Thought -> Action" path. The former belongs to the First Kind of Growth, the latter to the Second Kind of Growth. The former is the prerequisite and foundation for the latter; the latter is the supplement and expansion of the former. The former can be analogized to a child learning their mother tongue; the latter can be analogized to an ordinary person learning a foreign language. (This analogy is somewhat crude, as learning clearly does not equal growth. Growth implies an evolution from simple to complex, from potential to reality, from mutable to stable.) The more sufficient the First Kind of Growth, the greater the space for the Second Kind of Growth, and the greater the individual's "potential." If survivors wish to develop their capacity for action, they must, through diligent practice, make up for the First Kind of Growth that was left behind.

#### The Coordination of Body, Mind, and Intellect


A vibrant body cannot nurture a depressed heart. The coordination of Body, Mind, and Intellect was expressed by Peter Levine as "Three Brains, One Mind." When this coordination is intensely disturbed beyond the capacity for self-regulation, psychological problems appear.

Coordination can be divided into two opposing aspects, synergy and complementarity, and also into two opposing directions, top-down and bottom-up. On a long-term level, the activity levels of Body, Mind, and Intellect remain consistent. However, specific to any given moment, a situation of waxing and waning will repeatedly occur. The moment we capture an unusual breath in the environment, our limbs may freeze, but our brain becomes highly activated (manifesting as the sudden disappearance of large movements and the sudden intensification of micro-activities, activating detailed and comprehensive observation). Then, the limbs become active again, and the brain calms down slightly. This repeats multiple times until returning to a normal state. The degree of instantaneous brain activation reflects the individual's mental resources. If the brain activation is insufficient, the body will struggle to recover vitality from the freeze. Unless appropriate external force intervenes, the individual will continue to appear stunned. This is much like two people playing ping-pong: as long as one side fails to return the ball, the interaction stagnates, and both parties will be stunned in place until someone picks up the ball. In the course of repeated matches, the skill level of both sides will tend to converge.

Somatic Experiencing focuses on mind-body coordination; rebuilding the connection between the body and the intellect is a crucial component of SE. Cognitive therapy focuses on mental coordination; helping the individual establish a life narrative that fully reflects their own subjective reality is a crucial component of cognitive therapy.

#### The Two Dimensions of Traumatization


In the context of this article, "integration" and "differentiation" are two sides of the same coin. "Insufficient integration" and "insufficient differentiation" have essentially the same connotation. The difference is that insufficient integration emphasizes the "fragmented state" caused by trauma, while insufficient differentiation emphasizes the "chaotic state" caused by developmental stagnation. Integration is closely connected differentiation; differentiation is clarified integration. The antonyms for integration and differentiation are splitting and disintegration. The extreme form of splitting and disintegration is dissociative disorder.

The trauma healing process is akin to a team overcoming internal schisms and reforming its cohesion. Integration can be divided into two dimensions: "integration between levels" and "integration within the same level."

Insufficient integration between levels manifests as "having no backbone (lack of subjectivity)." The individual can only experience simple, intense emotions and make simple, crude stress responses; they cannot form delicate, complex feelings and thoughts. They easily interpret socializing as "acting" and "scheming."

Insufficient integration within the same level manifests as "self-conflict," or being "screwed up/twisted" (拧巴). The individual easily interprets socializing as "gossiping."

The higher the degree of integration within a level (or between levels), the more easily problems of insufficient integration between levels (or within a level) are exposed, and thus the more easily they are corrected in time. On a long-term basis, the degree of integration within levels and the degree of integration between levels remain consistent.

Integration or disintegration between levels can be perceived through changes in the mind-body state. Integration or disintegration within a level can be identified through self-coordination or self-conflict. Social situations (or other high-pressure situations) drive the individual to maintain a higher degree of integration *between* levels; at this time, problems of insufficient integration *within* the same level are easily exposed, while problems of insufficient integration *between* levels are easily concealed. Solitary situations are the opposite. For example, many CPTSD survivors feel completely normal when alone, but the moment they enter a social situation, they fall into sensory overload and feel at a complete loss. Many depressed individuals fall into endless cognitive rumination and exhibit difficulty initiating tasks when alone, yet they feel much better when they are with friends, at which point they will make many positive commitments to themselves. But once they return to solitude, they again fall back into a state of depression from which they cannot extract themselves.

#### Self-Help from the Integration View


From the perspective of inter-subject relations, the process of a survivor's self-rescue is the process of the adult individual using their "Adult Self" to take on the responsibility of the previously absent parent. Under scientific guidance and within social life, they educate the neglected "Child Self," cultivating its capacity for action and self-restraint. From the perspective of the subject-environment relationship, the process of self-rescue is the process of the subject resetting their own primitive impulses. The resetting of impulses is usually accompanied by intense, involuntary trembling.

### The Core of Interaction: Understanding Interaction Loops

Interaction forms "loops." One party initiates an invitation, the other responds, and the response in turn drives the initiator to change their state. Both parties' states rapidly change, mutually causing and affecting one another. Within the constant cycling of the interaction loop, impulses (in this article, "impulse" specifically refers to behavioral impulses), emotions, and concepts continuously emerge, develop, differentiate, and dissolve. The individual's adaptation to and transformation of the stimulus proceeds in sync.

In Raun K. Kaufman's autism home therapy technique (Son-Rise Program), the interaction loop is an important foundational concept. This article uses this concept as its logical starting point. All content in this article should be understood within the context of interaction loops.

Just as "symptom" (discomfort perceived by the subject) and "sign" (abnormalities found by an observer's examination) are different concepts, interaction loops can also be described from two different perspectives.

#### The Subject-Environment Interaction Loop


From the individual's (subject's) own perspective, all activity occurs within the subject-environment interaction loop. All other interaction loops are special cases of this loop. The process of the individual's own development is the process of the interaction between the subject and the environment becoming increasingly rich, and their intermingling becoming increasingly profound. In terms of subjective experience, the interaction loop is the infinite cycle of sensation and behavior. The subject-environment interaction loop can also be understood with the help of the concept of "reafference." The subject-environment interaction loop determines the individual's phenomenological world.

#### The Inter-Subject Interaction Loop


From the perspective of inter-subject relations, all activity occurs within the inter-subject interaction loop. The so-called subject-environment interaction loop is merely an instantaneous snapshot of the inter-subject loop, or perhaps the subject's "self-interaction." Self-interaction, however, is merely the internalization of inter-subject interaction. Internalization implies the accumulation of experience and the formation of habits.

This article does not accept a "God's-eye (omnipotent participant or omniscient observer) view." Even when discussing inter-subject relations, one subject must be chosen as the center of the discussion; otherwise, the narrator becomes the subject within a subject-environment loop. What they are narrating is no longer the story of the observed object, but their own story.

#### Observer and Participant


In the subject-environment interaction loop, the observer and the participant (or "doer") are directly unified. The narrative unfolding around the subject-environment loop is the "self-centric narrative." In the inter-subject interaction loop, the observer and participant are highly differentiated. The subject must possess considerable flexibility, maintain a balance between the two identities, and maintain relatively objective observation while actively participating in the activity.

Because survivors lack interpersonal interaction, their differentiation between these two roles is very low. They only perform well in situations where the two roles are not clearly differentiated (such as solving a math problem). When a life scenario involves the differentiation of the two, they either become pure observers, unable to integrate into the situation, or they degenerate into pure participants, constrained by others at every turn.

Psychological problems can only be fully exposed and resolved within the inter-subject interaction loop. When a subject wants to evade psychological problems, or even glamorize them as a kind of talent, they will often immerse themselves in the self-centric narrative and avoid the inter-subject interaction loop narrative.

The lack of interpersonal interaction means that survivors can only tell stories that satisfy them within the subject-environment narrative framework. They believe they are just objectively stating the story of the object they observed, unaware that this is precisely their own story. They are telling their own story, yet their self is absent from the story. They lack self-awareness regarding their own responsibility and influence.

The concept of observer and participant can be understood with the help of the concepts of "first-order chaos" and "second-order chaos" in Cybernetics.

#### Synchronicity


The subject-environment interaction loop is formed along with the differentiation of behavior and perception; it reflects the synchronicity between motor commands and perceptual feedback. In a newborn infant, the behavioral process, sensory process, and perceptual process are identical. They gradually differentiate, becoming concepts that, to an observer, are interconnected yet distinct. Identity thus becomes synchronicity. Synchronicity means mutual confirmation, mutual adaptation, and mutual blending. This synchronicity makes "me" into "the world's me," and the "world" into "my world." The process of the subject coming to know the world thus becomes the process of coming to know the self; the process of integrating different parts of the self becomes the process of integrating different aspects of the world.

Similarly, the inter-subject interaction loop is formed along with the differentiation of self and other (or "mine" and "not-mine"); it reflects the synchronicity of the two interacting parties. This synchronicity makes "me" into "the me within the relationship," and the "relationship" into "my relationship." The process of the subject establishing their own subjectivity becomes the process of recognizing the subjectivity of the other.

At any moment that the subject is alive, all their activities are proceeding within interaction loops. This is true whether these activities are attended to (conscious) or unattended to (unconscious), whether they are episodic (recallable) or non-episodic (unrecallable). All, and also infinite, interaction loops converge to form a person's stream of experience.

#### Cooperation and Confrontation


In the inter-subject interaction loop, the process of establishing and maintaining interaction is cooperation. Regardless of whether the attitude the subject conveys to the other party is supportive or opposing, as long as the goal is to maintain the interaction, one is affirming the other's sense of existence and influence. We receive the information conveyed by the other party, organize its main points, and then give our opinion. We acknowledge that both parties share the same discursive space (context), grant the other party the qualification of equal dialogue with us, and allow them to influence us. This is cooperation. Conflict is not frightening; conflict is what creates engagement. Only when two parties engage back and forth can they cooperate to produce a perfect drama. In the process of cooperation, both parties are profoundly influenced by each other, gradually taking on the imprint of the other.

In the subject-environment interaction loop, the concepts corresponding to cooperation are "exploration" and "blending."

Activities that hinder or destroy interaction are confrontation. Cooperation has continuity; confrontation has non-sustainability. Just as any achievement cannot be accomplished overnight but can be destroyed in an instant, confrontation will ultimately lead to new cooperation; otherwise, the subject will fall into crisis. The most famous example of confrontation is the non-violent non-cooperation movement organized and led by the Indian revolutionary Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

Special life experiences make it very difficult for survivors to share the same discursive space with others. The requests they make or the responses they give often deviate from social norms, causing confusion. This involuntary confrontation severely limits their interactive ability. To compensate for the damage they cause to the interaction, they often tend to over-cooperate, which results in them being easily influenced by things they do not like. This causes them great pain. Severe feelings of frustration cause them to increasingly escape reality. Escaping (avoidance) and running away (fleeing) are completely different concepts. Running away is a form of confrontation. Avoidance is neither cooperation nor confrontation; it is the stripping away of one's own social nature. Whether an act is avoidance or fleeing is sometimes not intuitive. It depends, to an extent, on the subject's sense of participation. Fleeing is often accompanied by excitement; avoidance is often accompanied by intense fear or even despair. A person who flees can conduct an effective review (post-mortem) after the fact. A person who avoids often struggles to justify their actions; their cognition exhibits fragmentation or even dissociative characteristics.

## Chapter 2: The Energy of Trauma: Arousal, Activity, and The Physical Self

### Concepts: Arousal Level and Vitality

#### The Concept of Arousal

In the context of Somatic Experiencing, there is no need to intentionally differentiate physiological arousal from psychological arousal. **Arousal** refers to the different states or degrees of the body's total physiological activation. It is a preparatory state for physiological and psychological activity, determined by the level of sensory excitability, glandular and hormonal levels, and muscular readiness. From the perspective of somatic experience, borrowing from the definition of emotion, arousal level is the subject's overall assessment of their own muscle tone level. The identification of emotion is based on the assessment of arousal level; in some psychological theories, emotions are classified according to different levels of arousal. When we say "feeling empowered," we mean feeling excitement, feeling a rise in our arousal level.

High arousal may make a person excited or anxious; low arousal may make them feel relaxed and pleasant or bored and indifferent. A high level of arousal can promote coarse or simple activities but will interfere with fine or complex activities. A lower level of arousal is conducive to completing fine or complex tasks but will hinder better performance in coarse or simple activities. Skills that require few decisions, have a narrow range of options, and demand high speed are suited to higher arousal levels. Skills involving a high number of stimuli, short durations, and low intensity achieve the best performance under relatively low arousal levels. The more muscles involved in an activity, and the higher the demand for muscular coordination, precision, and stability, the more likely the skill is to achieve ideal performance at a relatively lower arousal level. When an individual is relatively confident, they maintain a higher arousal level, prioritizing executive efficiency. When an individual lacks confidence, their arousal level drops to ensure that details are correct and considerations are thorough.

The stronger an individual's coping ability and the more sufficient their psychological preparation, the easier it is to maintain a relatively stable arousal level under pressure. Conversely, their arousal level is more prone to extreme fluctuations. If extreme fluctuations in arousal level occur frequently, they will inevitably cause psychological trauma, and this type of trauma is often difficult to trace back.

Some complex activities often impose seemingly contradictory yet subtle demands on arousal levels. For example, the sport of basketball requires both a sufficiently high level of excitement and sufficient precision and coordination (which can be understood from the perspectives of mind-body coordination and inter-subject coordination). It even demands that the arousal level be dynamically adjusted. These subtle demands are completely different from the self-contradictory demands proposed by malicious individuals intent on "suppressing" others. These demands—requiring the subject to maintain good activity levels while experiencing intense fluctuations in arousal—can be met in a process that is sufficiently informed, free, and provides timely feedback, without containing personal judgment or hidden motives. Such sports are generally very helpful for developing Emotional Intelligence.

The relative highs and lows mentioned here are relative to ordinary people; the survivor's situation is far more extreme. On the one hand, the survivor's daily arousal level is far lower than that required to maintain the optimal activation state of mind and body, to the extent that the vitality seen in others almost always makes them feel fear, rarely inspiring them to become active themselves. On the other hand, pressures that are trivial in the eyes of ordinary people often cause extreme arousal in survivors, making them terrified. Survivors appear dull and introverted while simultaneously expressing a strong desire for social connection. This contradiction gives them an impression of being "screwed-up" or "twisted" (拧巴).

An excessively low arousal level inevitably leads to insufficient muscle tone. Survivors often need to compensatorily tense their bodies during exercise. They find it very difficult to learn to complete movements easily and naturally like ordinary people—with large joints driving small joints, large muscles driving small muscles, in a relatively relaxed state. The survivor's body, just like their mind, always gives the impression of being both clumsy and fragile.

In ordinary people, arousal level and stress level are consistent. But in survivors, the mismatch between the two has become the norm.

#### Arousal Level and Activity Level

Arousal level is closely related to muscle tone. The relationship between activity level and muscle tone described earlier can thus be understood as the relationship between activity level and arousal level.

Activity level represents the freedom of activity; arousal level represents the intensity of activity. Under the same arousal level, the weaker the activity level, the simpler and cruder the behavioral expression; the stronger the activity level, the more complex and gentle the behavioral expression. Under the same activity level, the higher the arousal level, the stronger the subject's resilience (or "autonomy"); the lower the arousal level, the more docile the subject appears.

Arousal level and activity level are relatively independent within a certain range; when this range is exceeded, the two will constrain each other. In Janina Fisher's theory, this range is called the "window of tolerance." If a subject must be at a lower arousal level to maintain a good activity level, they will exhibit a relatively quiet and introverted personality. If a subject must be at a higher arousal level to maintain a good activity level, they will exhibit a relatively active and assertive personality. If a subject can maintain a good activity level across a wide range of arousal levels (possessing a large window of tolerance), they will exhibit an extremely resilient personality. Such an individual is "trauma-immune."

A trauma-immune person can maintain good activity levels even when experiencing dramatic fluctuations in arousal. A trauma-susceptible person only has good activity levels near their optimal arousal level.

When an individual simultaneously maintains a very high arousal level and a very high activity level, they can integrate all current activities into one, achieving the state of "multitasking." In other words, those who can multitask are all people who are full of energy and possess extremely strong concentration. This ability accompanied many people through their childhood, only gradually disappearing with declining energy and the accumulation of trauma.

Knowledge or skills are most easily recalled in the same mind-body state in which they were learned. Survivors are accustomed to learning knowledge, analyzing problems, and training skills at a very low arousal level. This knowledge and these abilities are difficult to access naturally under high-arousal stress states, which severely limits their adaptive capacity.

#### Vitality

The term "vitality" (活力) in common speech is a comprehensive assessment of both arousal level and activity level.

Vitality directly impacts the individual's experience of stress. A person with strong vitality always feels a "jolt to the heart" (a thrill) when facing stress; they often consciously seek stress to keep themselves in a relatively invigorated state. These people are "stress-preferrers." A person with weak vitality always feels a "tightening in the chest" when facing stress. They require extra physiological mobilization and psychological preparation to adjust their arousal level to a suitable place. These people are "stress-avoiders."

The best method and greatest challenge for filling oneself with vitality is to create a rich and colorful life full of positive emotional memories. Survivors must cherish every moment that awakens vitality in their lives, just as they would cherish a winter fire or the last candle flickering in the wind. They always complain that there is no sunshine in their lives, but in reality, it is their cognitive habits that cause them to selectively ignore these precious moments.

### Concepts: Activity, Activity Level, and Muscle Tone

#### Activity and Activity Level

At every moment we are alive, our bodies are engaged in abundant activity.

The "activity" (活动) mentioned in this article is by no means mechanical motion. All real-world activities, especially human social activities, possess both rhythm and a rich randomness and chaos. Imagine two people wrestling: through the qualities of their pushing, pulling, twisting, and tripping—firmness, reluctance, hesitation, volatility—they each feel that the other is a living person just like themselves, not a machine. Both are similar, yet each possesses a unique and appreciable personality.

Activity gains meaning through human participation. The process by which a subject makes sense of complex activities on a mental level is the same process by which the subject integrates into the activity on a mind-body level, attuning to the world; it is also the process of the subject fully exercising their own agency. If an individual cannot participate in an activity, they can only ever perceive chaos and randomness. The matching or resonance of activity is the prerequisite for forming a sense of affinity. **Activity level** (or "activeness," 活动性) is reflected in the subject's ability to constructively maintain and change the quality of their movements and the state of their activity, saving themselves from being "fixed" or "trapped." Activity level can be seen as the universal ability of natural things to protect themselves from "being defined."

Activity level enables the subject to respond purposefully to external stimuli. A healthy subject not only can respond to stimuli but also possesses the full freedom to choose *how* to respond; such a body feels nimble and agile. A boxer (especially one who is not yet seasoned) often must maintain a state of constant bouncing during a match. The purpose is to ensure the body reaches the level of activity required by the competitive situation. An active body provides sufficient response tendencies, ready to be triggered into various reactions at any time. It is like an inverted cone, in a state of unstable equilibrium, requiring only a tiny bit of force to tip it in any direction.

Rigidity, sluggishness (clumsiness), and flexibility (nimbleness) constitute a continuous spectrum describing the capacity for activity. Activity level, stress reactivity, flexibility, and mobility have similar connotations but different emphases.

Activity level, like body temperature and pulse, is difficult to consciously regulate. In the context of self-help, activity level is the most reliable and intuitive indicator of psychological health. The moment activity level drops sharply, the individual feels as if their "body is filled with lead." When activity level rises rapidly, the individual feels sharp-eared, clear-eyed, and light-bodied.

#### Activity and Perception

Activity produces perception; stillness causes paralysis. The "stillness" mentioned here refers specifically to phenomenological stillness; what is called "stillness" in daily speech is referred to as "calm" or "serenity" below. "Calm" is a cognitive judgment made by an observer based on sensory information; it is a state of activity that is subtle yet rich in content. The so-called sensations produced during calm are the sensations produced by these subtle activities. They enter perception as indescribable conscious objects, becoming the "background noise" or "baseline tone" of cognitive activity, referred to by some theories as the "subconscious." In the context of this article, **the body is the subconscious.**

Organisms' senses can only perceive activity; they cannot perceive stillness. This law clearly applies to organisms with much cruder sensory abilities than humans. For example, the famous "frog catching a mosquito" experiment proved that a frog can only perceive a mosquito in flight; it cannot perceive a stationary mosquito. If a person can realize, without any assistance, that this law also applies to humans, it usually means they possess a higher sensory processing sensitivity than ordinary people and can perceive finer, more subtle activities. For example, ordinary people can only clearly perceive the smell of the air in the brief moment they first enter a space. But a sensitive person can use the slight disturbances in the airflow to continuously savor these smells, thereby identifying them more accurately. The senses can only perceive activity and change. Its adaptive significance is to help us focus on more meaningful environmental information, but this also often leads to our lack of self-awareness.

Activity is relative; the subject's own activity also affects their perception of the environment. For example, we must constantly move our eyeballs to maintain vision, although this movement is usually subtle and requires no deliberate control. If we were to find a way to make the eyeballs stationary (which requires medication or extremely special mind-body states), we would quickly lose our vision. From another angle, we could say the senses have a tendency to "neutralize" (or "adapt" to) stimuli. For example, after staring at an object for a period, shifting our gaze allows us to see an afterimage, like a film negative, which is optically complementary to the real image. We must constantly move to prevent stimuli from being completely neutralized and thus imperceptible. Survivors' eye movements are far less active than those of ordinary people (often mocked as "dead fish eyes"); the visual information they perceive is far less vivid than that of ordinary people.

If we use projection or other methods to magnify our bodies, we will discover that even in a state of calm, our entire body is active, like the tips of branches in a gentle breeze. If we slightly move one part of our body, other parts of the body immediately change their state; it is impossible to move one part of the body in isolation without affecting the others. Our senses allow us to be aware of any subtle changes occurring in the body, but only significant changes can be expressed in language and receive meaningful cognitive processing in the public discursive space.

In states of extreme fatigue or severe depression, the body's activity level may drop abnormally. For example, sometimes when we wake up in the middle of the night, we may feel as if a part of our body has disappeared, but as soon as we move that part slightly, the sensation immediately returns. Or, in the groggy state just after opening our eyes in the morning, if we stare blankly at a corner for a long time, we may have the chance to see the objects in our field of vision gradually melt and lose their boundaries. Then, the visual field begins to show gaps. The gaps rapidly expand, as if a flood is about to engulf the entire visual field. At this moment, we will rapidly rotate our eyeballs due to the stress response, thereby restoring vision. (This experiment carries some risk; if the stress response cannot be evoked for some reason, it could lead to disastrous consequences. Therefore, this is only for reference; do not attempt it intentionally.) In both these situations, we have experienced phenomenological stillness.

Each individual has unique activity preferences. These preferences make the individual more sensitive in some aspects but also duller or even completely numb in others. Different activity preferences make everyone's experience of the world unique. Survivors' micro-activities are generally weak and monotonous, making it difficult to resonate with external activities. This lack of participation leads to their emotional indifference.

#### Micro-activity and Significant Activity

An activity can be observed on two levels: micro-activity and significant activity. The micro-activity level reflects the delicacy and subtlety of the activity; the significant activity level reflects the concreteness and episodic nature of the activity. The more concrete, significant, and intense the behavior, the more concrete, significant, and intense the activity. The state when an individual has the least significant activity but the most abundant micro-activity is their state of calm (also called the "neutral state" or "daily state").

Generally, physical activities that can be perceived as activity by the subject themselves or by their interaction partner are called significant activities. Activities that cannot be directly perceived as activity, but can be indirectly perceived through changes in perceptual quality, attention quality, emotional fluctuations, or changes in "aura," are called **micro-activities**. The "micro" in micro-activity emphasizes the subtlety of the degree, not the smallness of the scope (micro). The more subtle the activity, the more indivisible it is. On the extremely subtle level, all activities are one, forming the background of perception and setting its fundamental tone. Micro-activity reflects the overall pattern of brain activity. People perceive a person's mental state through their micro-activities.

Impulse (冲动) arises from micro-activity. That it cannot be perceived as activity by the senses means the generation of impulse is not controlled by willpower. Only when the impulse develops into action and specific behaviors begin to emerge can the subject become aware of them and consciously guide or inhibit them. Therefore, it can be said that "impulse precedes thought." Before people form a definite thought, the body has already produced an impulse. The thought is the confirmation of the impulse, allowing it to develop into a complete behavior. Through the accumulation of life experience, we establish a vast number of specific and subtle conditioned reflexes, the so-called "muscle memory." Muscle memory is a habitual impulse; it can guide behavior, evoke memories, and suggest thoughts.

The degree to which an impulse has developed at the moment it begins to be perceived by the subject as action (or recorded as behavior in episodic memory) is the threshold level between impulse and action (or micro-activity and significant activity). Due to their low activity levels, the threshold level that CPTSD survivors can perceive is usually much lower than that of ordinary people. They are, on the one hand, abnormally dull to activities outside their attentional focus, and on the other hand, they exhibit astonishing insight into activities within their attentional focus. When their activity level improves, this insight often degrades or even disappears.

Impulse precedes thought, so it is very difficult for a subject to "catch in the act" an impulse that is developing into action. Only under extremely rare circumstances (such as when the body is extremely fatigued but the brain is relatively clear, or when the subject is in the "half-awake state") do we have the opportunity to directly observe them. In most cases, the subject's awareness of their own impulses and unconscious behaviors is realized indirectly, through the responses of interaction partners in the interaction loop. The lives of CPTSD survivors are based on loneliness, lacking trustworthy partners. Their self-insight ability can be seen as a compensation for this loneliness. Unfortunately, few survivors can use this ability well. Under the effect of shame, this insight is often directed toward harsh self-inhibition and micro-management.

If impulse is the sprout of behavior, then micro-activity is the seed. The continuous conflict (confrontation) and compromise (blending) between infinite micro-activities constitute the basic content of micro-activity. (Generally speaking, behavior constitutes activity, but at the micro-activity level, distinguishing behavior and activity is meaningless.) All behaviors are developed through the mutual coordination of micro-activities. The nervous system is the structure specialized for coordinating bodily activities, and the brain is the core responsible for this coordination. The rising and falling of behavior will, in turn, "stir" micro-activity; therefore, abundant significant activity also makes micro-activity richer and more delicate. The relationship between micro-activity and significant activity is somewhat analogous to the relationship between lower-level structures and higher-level structures in the "Integrated Body-Mind View." From the perspective of micro-activity, micro-activity is equivalent to the stage and the entire performance troupe, while significant activity is just the program the actors perform on stage; any behavior in a significant activity is contained within micro-activity. From the perspective of significant activity, significant activity is like the actor's "one minute on stage," while micro-activity is the actor's "ten years of practice off stage." Any behavior requires the support of micro-activity; any significant activity contains countless micro-activities. The value of micro-activity must ultimately be realized through significant activity.

When an impulse forms and behavior begins to emerge, the micro-activity level will briefly decrease. This is equivalent to the body "tensing" in one or several specific directions, which somewhat affects all other directions. When the behavior is complete and the impulse subsides, the micro-activity level recovers, and the body returns to calm. In one complete activity, the body undergoes countless such "tense-relax" cycles. When we seriously attempt an unfamiliar activity, the body may "tense" in multiple directions simultaneously. We will feel the body become stiff and clumsy. This state is "freezing."

Different societies or different eras often have different ways of dividing conscious objects, different points of focus, and different tools of observation. Therefore, the ability to recognize significant activity not only varies individually but also varies between eras and societies. If a language lacks concepts or expressions related to a certain activity, then an individual's observation of it will be difficult to process meaningfully in the public discursive space. In such cases, it is often more economical for the individual to view it as a micro-activity subordinate to a larger significant activity. For example, regarding the "fake smile" expression, ancient Chinese people often used the phrase "skin smiles but the flesh doesn't smile (surface smiles but the inside doesn't)." Today, we already know that a fake smile means "the mouth smiles but the eyes don't," but if you wanted to communicate with an ancient person, the metaphysical expression "skin smiles but the flesh doesn't" would often be more efficient.

At the micro-activity level, activity level represents both the *ability* "to react arbitrarily" and the *state* of "being in constant flux." From the perspective of mechanical motion, a concept that confuses "ability" and "state" is absurd. But this very characteristic is the essential feature of a living organism, as the saying goes, "running water never goes stale, and a door-hinge never gets worm-eaten." Like the constant slight bouncing of a novice boxer, it keeps the subject sufficiently agile, while simultaneously *being* an unstable state. Thus, when discussing activity level, one must also consider the arousal level.

The qualities of significant activity and micro-activity are unified in the long term. Fluid movements can only come from a nimble posture. The subject's micro-activity capability and significant activity capability remain consistent in the long term.

People often use action sequences to describe significant activity and use mind-body states to summarize micro-activity.

#### Behavioral Activity and Psychological Activity

Behavioral activity and psychological activity are two sides of the same activity. Within the framework of Somatic Experiencing, it is meaningless to deliberately distinguish the two. Readers should consciously understand the word "activity" in this article from both the behavioral and psychological aspects. Self-helpers generally have keen observational skills; in their view, any psychological activity is always accompanied by certain behavioral activity. The nature and intensity of the psychological activity are directly defined by the behavioral activity.

#### Micro-activity and Perceptual Quality

Micro-activity determines perceptual quality. So-called perceptual quality is the background and keynote of perception. A good level of activity allows the brain to constantly receive sufficiently rich sensory stimuli, thereby maintaining arousal and providing abundant material for the formation of perception. The stronger the activity level, the better the quality of perception, just like a fully calibrated violin that can express the most perfect timbre.

Anxiety and depression can both destroy the body's micro-activities, causing sensory input to become deprived, monotonous, and lacking in various details. Even if the subject finds a seemingly meaningful conscious object, they will not dare to be certain because it fails to evoke the corresponding sensation. The subject will feel as if the world is no longer so vivid. Severely traumatized CPTSD survivors and individuals with Asperger's Syndrome severely lack various perceptual details; they and ordinary people seem to live in different worlds.

#### Activity Level and Reality Testing

People maintain their sense of reality through continuous interaction. Trauma-susceptible individuals have lower activity levels, and their reality testing ability is consequently weaker than that of ordinary people. They often experience various illusory, "sort-of-real-sort-of-not" sensations. They feel as if they are going crazy, but others just think they are being "melodramatic" or "oversensitive." This may push them to develop mystical tendencies.

Suppose we live for a long time in a harsh environment where we are easily criticized. A critical voice will then sound in our mind before our body acts. The adaptive meaning of this phenomenon is to remind us to adjust our behavior in time to avoid real criticism. Our body will tell us this is just an imagination, so it doesn't affect our adaptive capacity. Once we leave that environment, our imaginary perception will be updated through our exploration of the new environment, and the critical voice in our head will naturally disappear. But for a trauma-susceptible person, the feedback their body provides is too weak. Although the vividness of this voice is insufficient to form a hallucination, it is enough to exert a continuous influence on the subject. The sense of oppression brought by this voice has already merged into their "emotional backdrop." Their imaginary perception is difficult to update, trapping them, on a phenomenological level, in that harsh environment that severely restricts their activities. Their adaptive capacity thus struggles to develop.

#### Activity Level and Muscle Tone

At every moment a person is alive, their muscular system is engaged in an involuntary, subtle stretch reflex, causing the body, even in a calm state, to move like the tips of branches in a gentle breeze. These stretch reflexes are an important component of micro-activity. They maintain the stability, continuity, and smoothness of the human body's various postures and behaviors, continuously creating somatic sensation (proprioception) and forming the body's **muscle tone**.

People with long-term low activity levels often have abnormal muscle tone. Their limbs exhibit characteristics of overall excessive laxity and localized excessive tension (compensation), giving an impression of weakness and clumsiness. People with long-term high activity levels generally possess a more balanced level of muscle tone. In a state of calm, they possess good muscle excitability. It is precisely this excitability that gives the impression of "having spirit."

Muscle tone is different from muscle strength, but the regulation of muscle tone also requires various physical exercises. Long-term abnormal muscle tone (increased or decreased) will also lead to the degradation of muscle strength. Muscle weakness forces the subject to compensate by increasing muscle tone when engaging in many activities. However, a holistic change in muscle tone is always accompanied by emotional fluctuations, and emotional fluctuations interfere with cognitive processes. This makes them appear to have a bad temper and a slow brain.

The muscle tone level of survivors is, most of the time, lower than that of typically developing peers (hereafter "ordinary people"). In their infancy, they often already exhibit characteristics such as muscle weakness, unsteady walking, difficulty eating, excessive joint range of motion, an overly quiet personality, and being easily startled. They show strong inertia in daily activities; any slight activity (especially confrontational activities) seems exceptionally strenuous for them. They have never experienced a healthy state of excitement, making it difficult for them to realize that this feeling of weakness does not come from a lack of muscle strength, but from their own lack of "vigor." When they occasionally brace themselves and complete a challenge, they often have a feeling of "awakening," but due to a lack of self-awareness, this accidental state of awakening is often difficult to sustain.

People who are depressed and listless year-round often show various phenomena of premature joint degradation. When muscles provide insufficient support to the body, joint wear inevitably accelerates.

Note: When discussing physical signs, psychotherapy's methods and standards for determining abnormality are very different from clinical medicine. Clinical medical judgments must have universal applicability and will not consider too many individual factors. In psychotherapy, the identification of abnormal physical signs serves to identify the individual's mind-body state and therefore must fully consider differences between individuals and differences between an individual's various states. For psychotherapy, the clinical grading standards for muscle tone are too crude to be used. The "low muscle tone" or "high muscle tone" described in this article would almost never fall outside the range of normal muscle tone according to clinical grading standards.

#### Activity Level and Attention Quality

The shifting of attention involves abundant activities such as adjusting the line of sight and changing posture. For people with poor activity levels, regulating attention is also more strenuous. Compared to ordinary people, they are more likely to show obsession and fixation on specific things.

Based on the Integrated Body-Mind View, the activity levels of the body and the intellect remain consistent in the long term. Under normal circumstances, we can judge the intellect's activity level by observing the body's activity level, but the two can occasionally become misaligned. When the body's activity level significantly exceeds the intellect's activity level, the subject experiences a sense of being out of control; they feel they need to "slow down." When the intellect's activity level significantly exceeds the body's activity level, the subject experiences a sense of oppression; they feel they need a "distraction." (Because survivors generally suffer from alexithymia, they may only be able to experience a generalized sense of fear at these moments.) These brief moments of activity misalignment are often key nodes for healing and severely test the ability of the person concerned (including the helper, the helped, and the self-helper). It can be both a breakthrough point for transcending trauma and a source of secondary trauma.

#### Compulsivity

Compulsivity is the opposite of activity level. The subject feels the optional range of their behavior narrowing and experiences a strong sensation of acting against their will. Compulsivity is always accompanied by an abnormal decrease in activity level; the subject usually experiences a sense of rigidity or clumsiness. The formation of compulsivity requires two conditions to be met simultaneously: one is limited activity level, and the other is a positive feedback loop that opposes activity. For example, the "mental interaction" (hypochondriacal preoccupation) in Morita therapy: because attention is active, the more a subject pays attention to a certain thought or feeling, the stronger that thought or feeling becomes. This, in turn, causes the attention to become more fixated on that thought or feeling, thus forming compulsivity. Another example: a decline in activity level causes a variation in perceptual quality. The same action no longer produces the same feeling of completion. The subject feels as if they haven't done it right, that it's "just not quite there," and so they can only keep repeating it. The result of constant repetition might be finally finding that sense of completion, or it might be that the body becomes increasingly rigid and the sensory quality worsens, thus forming compulsivity.

### Concepts: Understanding Stress (Physiological and Psychological)

The Chinese word "应激" (yìng jī) originally meant to respond to a stimulus. "Stress" in English corresponds to Chinese terms that can mean responding to a stimulus, the "tense state" produced by the subject due to pressure (colloquially, "being stimulated"), or the "pressure" (压力, yā lì) that causes this tense state. Their connotations overlap highly but are not identical. This section primarily discusses pressure (stress).

#### Physiological Stress and Psychological Stress

The common ground between physical, physiological, and psychological concepts makes people willing to use the language of dynamics to describe psychological processes. This is one reason why psychodynamics has long held a place in psychotherapy.

Imagine we are in an environment with soft lighting and a harmonious atmosphere. A flashbulb suddenly goes off in front of us. The intense light hurts our eyes, causing us a stinging pain. At the same time, we feel a jolt in our hearts (startle). Our trust in the environment has been negated by an unexpected event. Our impulse to confront the environment intensifies. This strong impulse will rapidly develop into actions like squinting, turning the head, shielding, retreating, and trembling. If this psychological conflict is too intense, we might even freeze completely.

In this process, the stimulus event—the "unexplained flashbulb"—is the stressor, and our reaction is the stress response. Although the stress response is objectively directed at the stressor, it is, to a large extent, the product of psychological conflict. Physiological pressure arises between the stressor (which can now be called the pressure source) and the sensory organs, but psychological pressure does not arise directly between the stressor and the subject. Compared to physiological pressure, the "subject" involved in the interaction of psychological pressure is much more subtle and complex.

Physiological stress reflects humanity's natural attributes, whereas psychological stress is closely related to the individual's socialization process. Unless otherwise specified, the stress mentioned below refers to psychological stress. Psychologically, stress manifests somatically as a sensation of the internal organs being pulled (primarily transmitted by the vagus nerve), and cognitively as an experience of one's conscious space being compressed. True personality and intelligence quotient are only seen under psychological pressure. Many so-called high IQs are actually achieved at the cost of dissociation or even the sacrifice of parts of one's humanity.

#### Psychological Conflict and Psychological Stress

An absolutely chaotic world cannot attract our attention. A world can attract us to explore it only because it mixes a certain ineffable familiarity within its chaos, like a night sky scattered with stars. Place a young child in a novel situation, and they will immediately produce a contradictory feeling of unfamiliarity and familiarity. There are patterns in the situation that they recognize, but they are operating in an unfamiliar yet powerful way. The child feels both blending and hostility. They have both an impulse to merge into the situation and an impulse to resist it. These contradictory impulses confront each other, putting the child into a stress state. The body shows a slight freeze, while the cerebral cortex activity level surges. This feeling is vigilance, and this state is "curiosity." The interaction between one's own different impulses or tendencies is **psychological conflict**.

Psychological conflict can be likened to "tug-of-war." The difference is that in a tug-of-war, both sides always pull at the same time on the referee's command, whereas psychological conflict is often sudden. There is often an extremely subtle time lag between the conflicting parties (or multiple parties). This suddenness has a similar physiological significance to the impact in a knee-jerk reflex: it triggers the startle reflex. A subtle startle reflex is experienced as "surprise"; a significant startle reflex is being "startled" or "jump-scared." The startle reflex belongs to the category of unconditioned reflexes and is the starting point of the stress process.

Psychological conflict produces psychological pressure; psychological pressure creates a feeling of tension. A person with learned helplessness always yields easily and thus feels no pressure.

Psychological pressure affects the arousal level; the rise in arousal level creates a sense of vigilance. In other words, before we feel tense and vigilant, our body has already reacted. We can only comply with these reactions, guiding them to be constructive; we cannot completely control them. Our consciousness controls the body's "steering wheel" and "clutch" but does not hold the switch to the "engine." Although the stress response is largely subconscious, it reflects the subject's long-term accumulation more than it does a real-time strategy. The most natural parts of life are precisely the parts we have trained the most; we just often lack awareness of this training. So-called intuition is the product of accumulated experience. Socially experienced people can understand a person's character and history by observing their stress responses. A reliable trauma self-help strategy can guide us in responding to our body's stress reactions, gradually adjusting our stress patterns through the long-term accumulation of life experience. Being honest with one's own stress responses is the prerequisite for developing coping abilities. If we intervene in our stress responses directly at the neurophysiological level (such as using medication), although it might temporarily change the stress patterns we don't want, it will also produce terrifying chain reactions.

If a map has large blank areas, it leaves room for imagination. For an outstanding explorer, these blank spaces are like an invitation from a friend; he will excitedly set off on the path of exploration. But for an ordinary person, these blank spaces are like the devil's temptation, hiding terrible risks of life and death, which they avoid from a distance. When the subject faces a chaotic world awaiting exploration, the impulse to blend with it and the impulse to confront it conflict and compromise with each other, ultimately deciding the emergence of different actions, emotions, and viewpoints.

Returning to the child example. The conflicting impulses cause the child to fall into a slight freeze. They will turn to their social support system for help. If the caregiver shows an attitude supportive of exploration, the impulse to approach the space-to-be-explored will receive more support. The child will begin exploration under pressure, the chaotic world will gradually become clear, and the child's psychological reality (phenomenological world) will expand during the exploration. Otherwise, the child will continue to observe until they receive more information supporting approach or escape. "Supporting exploration" is not determined by what the caregiver says; rather, it means the child sees in the caregiver the attitude and aura associated with successful exploration, which activates the behavioral patterns associated with successful exploration within the child. If the caregiver has an encouraging look in their eyes but constantly creates obstacles for the child's exploration, then that look will no longer serve an encouraging function and may even exacerbate the child's freeze. This contradictory pattern is visible in many failed caregivers. They appear very supportive of exploration, but the moment the child begins to explore, they become even more nervous than the child. These caregivers suffer from their own severe psychological trauma; the child's exploratory behavior easily triggers their emotional flashbacks. Not only are they unable to provide spiritual support for the child, they actually intensify the child's fear, yet they are completely unaware of this. Over time, any encouragement will struggle to function as support. The child's curiosity and exploratory abilities will be severely damaged, and their personality development severely limited.

Only when our understanding of psychological pressure reaches this level of specificity can we systematically analogize it to force in the physical sense. Otherwise, psychodynamics can only be seen as a crude metaphor of very limited significance.

#### The Devil's Balloon

Likening a psychological system to a physical system is, of course, unreliable. However, on a basic epistemological level, we have never far surpassed the analogical imagination of the ancients, such as "rotting grass transforms into fireflies." Analogy is the basic human method for understanding the world and sharing experience. When we first encounter an unfamiliar concept, we always subconsciously analogize it to concepts we are familiar with. The appropriateness of the chosen analogy directly determines the speed at which we accept the new concept.

To help understand concepts like pressure in psychodynamics, I have previously used the analogy of a suspended balloon.

Now, you see a balloon of no thickness, full of air, suspended in mid-air. Inside and outside of it, all air molecules are moving rapidly and randomly, colliding. This ceaseless collision allows the balloon to maintain a certain shape and volume. This balloon is equivalent to a person. This state of stable suspension is equivalent to a person's state of calm. It appears quiet, but inside, it is not peaceful at all. The restless molecules inside the balloon are equivalent to the constantly churning impulses in a person's heart. The collisions of all air molecules inside the balloon form the balloon's internal pressure; this is equivalent to a person's psychological pressure. The air molecules collide on both sides of the balloon wall, reaching a dynamic equilibrium. The interaction between the inner and outer sides of the balloon wall constitutes the pressure between the balloon and the outside world; this is equivalent to the pressure between a person and the environment. Unlike the balloon, a person only acknowledges the pressure the environment exerts on them; they do not acknowledge the pressure they exert on the environment.

Now, the devil stretches out his hands and begins to squeeze the balloon from both sides. The balloon's volume begins to shrink. Simultaneously, the collisions of the molecules inside become more intense. The collisions opposing or perpendicular to the direction of the squeeze are especially intense; this is equivalent to impulses developing into specific confrontational behaviors. The balloon's surface area increases due to the squeezing. The balloon wall, in the direction perpendicular to the squeeze, becomes thinner and more "tense," as if some molecules are about to burst through the wall; this is equivalent to the individual experiencing an intense feeling of tension and a tendency toward dissociation under immense pressure. The pressure inside the balloon and the pressure between the balloon and the outside world rise simultaneously. Finally, the balloon either explodes (dissociation and breakdown), slips out of the devil's hands (escape and recovery), or reaches a new equilibrium (acceptance and adaptation). This entire process is stress.

The balloon did not appear from thin air; the devil brought it from somewhere else. Before you saw it, it was already trying to adapt to the air here. In other words, it was already in a state of stress. But we don't have time right now to care about its previous stress process. We can only use the state we first saw as our baseline reference. This baseline state is the "no-pressure" state. The pressure added *onto* this no-pressure state is the pressure we currently care about.

Now, the devil casts a spell on the balloon, causing all the air molecules inside it to stop moving instantly. The internal temperature of the balloon immediately drops to absolute zero. Because the balloon has lost the tension generated by the collision of internal air molecules, and ignoring the volume of the air molecules and intermolecular repulsion, the balloon's volume rapidly shrinks to zero under the compression of the outside air. The pressure between it and the environment disappears, and the pressure inside it also ceases to exist. This state is phenomenological stillness. It is the true no-pressure state. It signifies the disappearance of a person's social existence; they are, in a sociological sense, dead.

#### The Heart of a Child

Take learning to use a smartphone as an example.

For a child, a smartphone is like a night sky scattered with stars; within the chaos, there is an ineffable familiarity. Although the child is familiar with the actions of "poking" and "tapping," the various effects brought about by different combinations of poking and tapping bring them vibrant experiences. When a child gets a phone, they are immediately attracted by the strange combinations of buttons and color blocks. Through constant probing, the child gradually discovers certain patterns and then slowly masters how to use the phone.

For an adult who has never touched a smartphone, these pokable, tappable buttons are unlikely to arouse their interest. What buttons have they not seen before (even though they indeed have not seen *these*)? These combinations of buttons and color blocks are, to them, familiar to the point of boredom. Poking and tapping is, to them, childish to the point of absurdity. But the world inside the phone is, to them, absolute chaos. They cannot connect these dull combinations to a vibrant new world. The two are too disconnected; they do not bring the feeling of "familiar yet strange," and thus do not arouse their curiosity. When they need to use a smartphone, it is inevitably because they have encountered some important task. The phone is just a vehicle for this task. They will not start learning the phone's operation from scratch just to complete these tasks, just as an ordinary person wouldn't make dumplings just for a dish of vinegar. They have neither the patience nor the time. The seriousness of these tasks also does not permit them to familiarize themselves with the operation by poking and tapping with intense focus but without regard for consequences, as a child does.

These factors prevent many adults from ever being able to rapidly accept new things and develop adaptive capacity as teenagers do. However, there are always exceptions around us. They seem to retain the heart of a child forever—full of passion like a child, indomitable, and curious about everything. These people are the role models for survivors. Survivors must find such role models for themselves. Otherwise, even if they walk out of the shadow of trauma, they will struggle to adapt to society, having fallen behind on so much developmental homework.

### Pathology: The Stress Response (Fight, Flight, and Freeze)

#### Stress and Coping

Stress (应激, *yìng jī*) and coping (应对, *yìng duì*) are two sides of the same process. Stress emphasizes the reflexive aspect; coping emphasizes agency. The process of CPTSD self-rescue is the process of using agency to regulate reflexivity, and then using reflexivity to develop agency. In the context of self-help, deliberately distinguishing between stress and coping is meaningless. The two can be jointly defined as a series of non-specific processes the subject undergoes after their state of equilibrium is broken (or the interaction loop is disturbed), utilizing the energy provided by the sharply increased arousal level to complete coping and restore equilibrium. All complete stress (coping) processes must end with the restoration of calm and the development of adaptation.

A complete stress process requires not only mind-body integration but also inter-subject coordination. The more deficient the subject's cognitive resources and external support, the higher the demand the stress process places on the subject's own physiological regulatory abilities. If the subject lacks cognitive resources and external support, and their body is too weak, the physical energy used to maintain the stress state is easily depleted quickly, causing the stress process to end in a stalemate. If we apply Hans Selye's three-stage General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) model to describe this, the body's resistance to pressure has already entered the exhaustion phase before the complete stress process is finished. The subject's mind-body state thus cannot return to equilibrium. This will, at the micro-activity level, destroy the subject's ability to withstand and cope with pressure, causing the subject to feel increasingly "twisted" or "stuck" during normal stress processes. Their own activity level becomes more and more restricted. The originally neutral stress response begins to be mixed with more and more negative emotions. Over time, the subject will inevitably develop CPTSD. CPTSD signifies various intertwined, unresolved stress processes.

A person is coping with various pressures at every moment they are alive. Even in a state of calm, stress is constantly occurring at the level of micro-activity. Similar to the division of drives, stress can also be divided into stress that maintains baseline arousal and stress that copes with significant imbalance. A traumatic event may initially appear as a challenge (acute) or torture (chronic), but what it ultimately affects is the stress that maintains baseline arousal. Stress disorders can only be fully exposed under a state of intense stress, and only then receive meaningful cognitive processing in the public discursive space. Somatic Experiencing focuses on how to allow the subject to safely approach (i.e., "titrate") and maintain (i.e., "mindfulness") this intense state of stress without losing control; to then identify and complete the long-unresolved stress processes; and finally, on a cognitive level, to integrate the story of the trauma into the subject's own life journey. As we can see, Somatic Experiencing focuses on coping with significant imbalance stress. Unless otherwise specified, the stress mentioned hereafter refers to this kind of stress. To fully integrate the trauma story into the subject's life history, the process of completing the coping cannot be simplistic and crude. Effective psychotherapy actually cultivates our ability to "maneuver" and "circle around" (周旋) stress.

A complete stress process can be summarized as: Impact -> Surprise (accompanied by experiences of staggering, shock) -> Composure (pulling oneself together) -> Exploration -> Differentiation (slicing and dicing the problem) -> Developing blending or releasing confrontation -> Impact is resolved. An ordinary person will quickly stabilize after a brief stagger and summon energy to prepare a counter-attack. But a survivor, accustomed to self-focus, spends too much energy experiencing the feeling of dissociation, and may even derive a drunk-like comfort from the dissociation. Because the processes of composing oneself and releasing aggression cannot be completed, the survivor's stress process may remain stuck in an unfinished state long-term, thus forming psychological trauma. For an ordinary person, staggering and shock immediately put the subject into a stress state, after which they concentrate on exploration and responding. Therefore, the fluctuation in arousal level is felt more as excitement or vigilance rather than fear.

#### Freeze

The **freeze** (僵直, *jiāng zhí*) discussed in this article does not solely refer to the state of being completely stiff and unable to move due to extremely increased muscle tone. Rather, it includes the continuous spectrum from a slight decrease in flexibility (tension) to an extreme freeze (being frozen). The greater the intensity and the longer the duration of the pressure, the more significant the freeze. Freeze is a state of being unable to utilize one's strength; it signifies that exploration is deadlocked. Freeze is experienced as clumsiness, vulnerability, and fear, accompanied by an overall increase in muscle tone level. Although freeze makes exploration difficult, it makes simple, crude confrontation easier. In an ideal stress process, the subject's various behaviors converge at the exact moment the freeze reaches its extreme, resulting in the simplest, most powerful, and most accurate response.

Freeze is also a compensatory reaction. It turns our muscles into "armor" for the body, to some extent, giving the body resistance to impact when the nature of the pressure cannot be clearly determined. An individual with a very low level of coping ability development might even sloppily use freeze to cope with all impacts. This phenomenon can be called "habitual freeze." Habitual freeze means the subject has lost their "courage"; their stress response will be dominated by fear. Persistent freeze and habitual freeze inevitably lead to the degradation of activity capacity, which is "rigidity."

When an object impacts you from all directions, and you can neither release aggression to complete the confrontation nor calm down enough to explore carefully, you will fall into a freeze and experience fear. For example, you are standing on an unfamiliar, suspended steel plate. You dare not release confrontational impulses, as this might make the situation more dangerous. You also cannot completely calm down, because you do not know how reliable the plate is; it could break or detach at any moment. The clumsy state is a focused but strenuous state of exploration. The subject is extremely vulnerable at this time, with poor ability to resist harm. A person who provides support in this "vulnerable state" will be identified by the subject as a friend; one who makes the vulnerable state even more vulnerable will be identified as an enemy.

Imagine you are a child. You have seen things similar to a basketball, but you have never played basketball. You are exploring the environment without the protection of a significant trustworthy object (like your mother). Suddenly, you notice a basketball flying toward your face. You feel its visual impact. At this moment, your body, based on past general impressions of similar objects, produces a subtle, probing blend with it. It is as if the ball hasn't arrived, but you have already been hit to some degree; this is an "imaginary perception." You can use this perception to assess the relationship between the ball's force and speed and your own ability to bear it and react. You *feel* (rather than analyze) the potential harm it may bring and prepare to react. At the same time you feel this imaginary impact, the body's stretch reflexes also make you feel the potential power within your own body to resist the impact, just like the resistance you feel when pushing a tumbler toy off its balance point. Therefore, this visual impact can also be seen as an invitation, inviting you to feel and release your own strength. This imaginary feeling of being hit, just like a real impact, evokes your stress response, making you feel "surprised." At this moment, you are in the composure phase (pulling yourself together).

The faster composure is completed, the stronger the subject's adaptive capacity. If composure cannot be completed, the arousal level will continuously rise in an attempt to evoke more mind-body resources. If the body consistently fails to produce any optional behavioral impulses (or prepare the action sequence that matches this impact), the subject may freeze and experience fear. At this moment, the role of a trustworthy object is crucial. It can guide the subject to make deeper differentiations (cuts) that match their own reaction capabilities and make an effective response that matches the object-to-be-explored, barely completing the exploration under high arousal. This is crucial for developing the subject's coping ability. After composure is complete, you will complete the exploration (learning to effectively catch the ball) or initiate a fight (frantically, even angrily blocking or batting it away) or flight (escaping) response. The stress response is complete. If the subject cannot confirm the relationship between the explorable object and the trustworthy object (a trustworthy object is part of one's own resources, an extension of the subject), they cannot complete the exploration and cannot differentiate a conscious object that matches their own reaction capabilities. If the differentiation of the conscious object is negated by a trustworthy object or by one's own cognitive schema (for example, the trusted person is the perpetrator), the subject may fall into a daze (trance).

A daze (恍惚, *huǎng hū*) is a signal of difficulty in differentiation. If you remain unable to compose yourself, you can only fall (collapse), or even surrender to the imaginary perception of being hit (the impulse to fall) and proactively fall. In other words, you have already surrendered before the ball actually hits you. Surrendering prematurely prevents your sense of fear from developing to an earth-shattering degree, but the price is that your coping ability fails to develop at all. Over time, you will develop a habitual fear. All similar acute stress events will evoke your fear and withdrawal, and your exploratory ability will gradually collapse. Habitual fear is not the end point. As surrender becomes more proficient and more "timely," you will no longer be able to experience a sense of crisis or fear, which means your coping ability has failed. You are no longer capable of distinguishing between an "invitation" and an "intrusion." You are unable to independently confront a crisis and unable to respond to others' support. Habitual fear finally develops into learned helplessness.

Anger and fear are antagonistic. After differentiation is complete, fear may transform into anger or other more complex emotions. The stronger the fear, the stronger the anger it transforms into. The energy within the emotion is dissipated along with the release of aggression.

#### Development of Coping Ability

Under the demonstration of the trustworthy object, you personally pat the ball, feeling its weight and texture. You first try tossing and catching at close range a few times, then try intense, rapid tossing and catching. The advantages and shortcomings of your actions receive timely feedback from the trustworthy object. You realize that as long as you remain calm, you are fully capable of catching it well. Furthermore, you are absolutely not just the character who catches the ball; you can also throw the ball to others, and others will respond readily. With these experiences, you will not easily see a flying ball as an attack on you. Your attention will also focus more on the ball's movement, rather than excessively focusing on your own emotions and reactions. This is a typical positive process for developing coping ability.

Survivors are only adept at exploration under low arousal levels. High arousal levels require trusting one's senses and instincts and appropriately relying on aid; there is no time for full cognitive processing. Survivors do not understand how to trust others, and thus they easily feel fear and feel shame for their lack of composure and their clumsiness.

Exploring while maintaining a high arousal level can be likened to a person who has fallen into water desperately grabbing onto anything they can to maintain their balance, not just flailing wildly. In this situation, the subject lets go of all self-inhibition, fully trusting their senses and instincts. If the subject can let go of toxic, extreme shame, they will have the chance to gradually become aware of the friendly signals that others are constantly emitting. They may even discover that they are slowly able to sense other people's personalities, no longer confined to endless, patternless behavioral details.

Exploration under high arousal can be seen as a compression of exploration under low arousal. If a subject always exhibits a very slow and delicate style under low arousal and lacks efficient performance, then exploration under high arousal is more likely to result in fear and freeze.

If the quality of every fight-or-flight response is poor, and the subject is always in a state of lingering fear after the acute stress event ends, this likewise means the stress process was not completed. After repeating such experiences many times, the subject will also learn abnormal emotional reflexes.

Survivors spend much of their lives in a "vulnerable state." The environment has too little trustworthiness for them, which limits their exploration of explorable objects. When they exhibit an exploratory ability that looks normal to ordinary people, their level of reliance on trustworthy objects is actually far greater than that of ordinary people. This is observable to an attentive person. This makes it possible for them to establish deeper psychological bonds, but also makes them more susceptible to exploitation and harm.

#### Psychological Resilience

The quality of the stress process manifests as psychological resilience. Good psychological resilience manifests during the stress process as being tense but not showing fear (not "showing the white feather"), much like Jack's performance at the dinner party in the movie *Titanic*. Tension means the full activation of mind-body energy; not showing fear means having the ability to carry this immense energy. Psychological resilience is also a manifestation of emotional intelligence.

If we liken an individual's psychological resilience to the elasticity of a spring leaf, and stress to the physical pressure exerted on that spring leaf, then the complete process of stress can be analogized to the process of the spring leaf deforming and then returning to its original shape. If the pressure exceeds the spring leaf's elastic limit, the spring will undergo inelastic deformation; even when the pressure is removed, it cannot return to its original shape. At this point, if we try to bend it back to its original shape, we will feel a force resisting restoration. In other words, the spring has "internalized" the pressure it previously received and entered a "new normal." If the subject forces themself to return to the original calm state, they will feel a kind of tension stored in their body that can neither be accurately located nor discharged. This is "parasitic tension." Parasitic tension internalizes the confrontation between the subject and the stressor into the subject's "self-conflict." When they face a situation that requires the original state to overcome, they will feel an inexplicable pressure.

### Pathology: Trauma from the Perspective of Activity

#### Trauma and Activity Degradation

Good activity level is the prerequisite for developing adaptability and psychological resilience. Trauma is always accompanied by the degradation of activity level and abnormal daily arousal levels. The degradation of activity level limits the ability to resist pressure. The subject's resistance to stress is always rapidly depleted, making them more susceptible to forming new traumas, thus creating a vicious cycle. Therefore, a trauma-susceptible person is not only "fragile" but will become increasingly fragile, until they either make up their mind to change or completely lose faith in life.

Self-conflict, excessive fatigue, environmental and resource limitations, and hidden "domestication" (taming) can all cause activity to become sluggish. The subject's activity level progressively declines, and vitality constantly decays. Activities that were originally effortless, requiring no attention, almost instinctive, begin to occupy more and more attention. The curiosity response evoked by external stimuli becomes weaker and weaker. These changes all indicate the existence of trauma. To guarantee the efficiency of activity, the subject has no choice but to lower their arousal level, making the body slack, and then use willpower to drive the cumbersome body. Doing so brings an enormous sense of depletion. Survivors may look lazy, but their mental exhaustion during activities is by no means small. This is like a marionette puppet whose joints have lost their flexibility. The operator doesn't know how to repair the joints, so they can only soften the puppet's limbs and directly twist the puppet by hand to barely complete the original actions. This causes the survivor's behavior generally to give the impression of being "screwed-up" or "twisted," as if they are perpetually caught in a dilemma, unable to advance or retreat.

Survivors whose traumatization process began excessively early may not even recognize what "drive" is. They believe all activities must be driven by willpower and are therefore always terrified by the powerful energy that spontaneously emerges in ordinary people during activities.

The progressively declining arousal level coordinates with the "economizing effect" of parasitic tension, allowing the survivor to remain self-consistent. Therefore, they rarely take the initiative to change their state. Only when they enter society and begin to live independently, and the experience of hitting walls everywhere makes them doubt their life, will they generate the motivation and willingness to change themselves.

An abnormal decline in activity level means the subject has entered a sub-health state. CPTSD survivors commonly suffer from autonomic nervous system dysfunction and low immunity.

#### Wear-and-Tear Trauma

If pressure lasts too long and is inescapable, the body's micro-activities may degrade. The subject may appear rigid and stiff, exhibiting certain compulsive or neurotic traits. Wear-and-tear trauma is also called "subtle trauma." Long-term, continuous "wear" can cause extremely severe consequences. Wear-and-tear trauma is also one of the sources of CPTSD. The pressure that causes subtle trauma is a terrifying force that is long-term, continuous, and inescapable. It is a test of the subject's own physiological functions, experiential reserves, and social support system. In the context of this article, the prefix "subtle" (微) always means "subtle," not "micro" (minor).

Chronic physical illness is also a source of wear-and-tear trauma, especially when the cause cannot be determined and the subject's various unique sensations are dismissed by irresponsible doctors as "hallucinations."

If the subject has not developed good self-soothing abilities through their attachment relationship with caregivers, the subtle rigidity accumulated under daily stress will become parasitic tension, as it cannot be released. They will become increasingly clumsy, and their trauma immunity (stress resistance) will weaken, to the point that very ordinary stress events are enough to cause psychological trauma.

"Putting oneself in another's shoes" is the basic method people use to understand others. When survivors substitute their own low activity level into their understanding of others, they only feel that others are incredibly powerful yet completely unreliable. This only increases their vigilance and prevents them from developing an interest in others' worlds. Without interaction, there is no matching or resonance, and thus no sense of affinity is produced. In the survivor's eyes, other people are often just a chaotic pile of patternless activities. It is very difficult for the survivor to feel what "personality" is. The immense sense of depletion brought by interpersonal interaction will cause them to become increasingly resistant to social contact.

Experiencing violence, physical injury, and emotional abuse can profoundly change a person's life. But what most people don't know is that many events that appear mild and harmless can also cause psychological trauma in a person. The consequences of trauma are sometimes widespread and hidden. From the perspective of subtle trauma, all embarrassing and tense experiences deserve sympathy, all tense experiences that yielded no reward deserve to be mourned, and all tense experiences where one strove and achieved a result deserve to be commemorated and met with gratitude.

#### Fragmented Self-Cognition

Humanity's various intuitions and fleeting thoughts may seem to lack logical connection, but in reality, they all emerge upon the common foundation of micro-activity. The reality-based nature of micro-activity determines the reality-based nature of these intuitive thoughts. Severe CPTSD destroys the micro-activity that serves as the common substrate for all activities. Only then can we see what chaotic intuition and thoughts really mean. The reality-based nature of micro-activity provides rich cues for memory retrieval. People with abnormal activity levels always exhibit a certain characteristic of unexpected forgetfulness.

Imagine a mountaineering enthusiast who loses the ability to climb due to an accident. Generally speaking, although the thought of climbing will still surface from time to time, this thought will quickly turn into deep mourning. However, suppose they suffer from severe CPTSD. They might, after the thought emerges, unthinkingly begin preparations. Only when they realize the wish can no longer be fulfilled do they begin to fall into mourning. But not long after, the same thought may emerge again, and they restart preparations... this cycle repeats many times, until their attention is occupied by other activities. If a survivor frequently exhibits this kind of behavior, we say their self-cognition has lost its integration. Fragmented self-cognition makes the survivor's intuition frequently interfere with normal life, rendering it unreliable. Survivors with fragmented self-cognition often have very low arousal levels and exist daily in a half-awake, dissociated state.

### Tools: Biological Rhythms and Deep Breathing

#### Deep Breathing

The inhale-exhale cycle is the simplest and most natural tense-relax cycle. Awareness Through Movement generally requires the subject to adjust and experience changes in body state while engaged in slow, deep breathing. Breathing can influence arousal levels. The Valsalva maneuver can help safely and rapidly increase arousal levels (those with cardiovascular issues should not attempt this casually), while steady, deep breathing helps maintain arousal stability.

Breathing is an inherent biological rhythm of the organism. All biological rhythms that are simultaneously regulated by higher central centers, lower central centers, and the autonomic nervous system—including but not limited to "breathing," "sleep," "swallowing," and "excretion"—are important tools for self-regulation. Severe psychological problems generally begin affecting the subject's quality of life by disrupting these biological rhythms. If a person's bowel movements are regular while working away from home, but they frequently experience diarrhea or chronic constipation during periods at home, this variation in biological rhythm likely indicates the presence of family trauma; the reverse may indicate social trauma.

#### Emotional Rhythms

Many people have experienced the feeling of waking in the middle of the night, overwhelmed by frustration and fear. Dragging their exhausted body, various negative and pessimistic thoughts surface in their mind: Does the parents' argument signal the breakup of the family? Does the cold response from a crush mean I've been found out? etc. By noon the next day, when the body has the most vitality, they become ambitious again. Recalling their thoughts from the middle of the night, they find them simply absurd.

In this process, our mind-body state undergoes a swing from low to high. Even if we sit quietly for a day without experiencing any major stimulation, our mood will cycle from listless to elevated. This is our "emotional rhythm." A person's mental state, just like their physical state, has diurnal cycles, seasonal cycles, life cycles, and even generational cycles. Cycles at different levels nest within each other, causing our psychological state, even when calm, to constantly change like the weather.

Corresponding to emotional fluctuations, our body simultaneously exhibits a rhythm of contraction and expansion. In Somatic Experiencing, this rhythm is called "pendulation." Pendulation represents the body's innate restorative rhythm and is the core of the capacity for self-regulation.

The process of pendulation is the process of the body's internal resistance (stability), resilience, and organizational power (self-organization) taking effect. Pendulation is like the ocean waves, constantly washing over the imprints left on our hearts by past experiences. Most of the time, pendulation is completed in the unnoticed corners of our consciousness, allowing our attention to remain focused on the work at hand. If the surging emotional memories are too strong, or if the subject falls into a state of idleness for various reasons, these emotional materials will occupy the center of consciousness, and the subject may consequently fall into cognitive rumination.

Survivors' emotional rhythms tend to be disordered or even exhausted. Not only is their mind-body state poor, but their ability to regulate their mind-body state is also poor. It is, as the saying goes, "a leaking roof on a rainy night" (one disaster after another). Repairing the pendulation rhythm and strengthening its stability is one of the cores of CPTSD treatment.

Improving the function of the autonomic nervous system through physical exercise is beneficial for improving the body's biological rhythms. Severe autonomic dysfunction requires medication; please follow a doctor's advice for specific medication.

### Tools: Somatic Experiencing and The Feldenkrais Method (Gaining Flow)

In a counseling context, Somatic Experiencing (SE) is generally used to treat PTSD, because the self-conflict in PTSD survivors is often simple and intense. Its typical process can be summarized as: creating a relatively safe environment (the client and therapist form a trusting relationship) -> supporting the client in exploring and accepting somatic experiences -> establishing a space for pendulation and containment of arousal -> using the "titration" technique to promote the functioning of the "pendulation" instinct -> exploring and experiencing the internal resources present before and during the traumatic event, replacing the collapse and helpless negative response with an active, powerful confrontational response -> connecting internal resources with the traumatic experience, consciously exploring everything in the body and mind that causes discomfort -> continuing to use titration techniques, utilizing the pendulation instinct, separating conflicting impulses (e.g., the impulse to communicate externally and the impulse to dodge out of aversion) -> completing the suspended orienting response and stress process -> the response inhibition is lifted, the blocked survival energy is released and redistributed -> the neutral state is restored -> reconnecting with the environment and restoring the interactive-equilibrium attention quality.

In a self-help context, SE can be used to process CPTSD, because the survivor's self-conflict is often complex and subtle. In this situation, the process by which SE functions is one where the subject uses *felt sense* (experience/体会) as a tool, making a series of fine and subtle adjustments at the micro-activity level, to return the "trauma vortex" and the "healing vortex" to harmony. A common process can be summarized as: acquiring an "awakening" experience -> paying attention to one's own drive -> maintaining the dialogue between body and intellect -> breaking through self-inhibition. This process is always accompanied by fluctuations in arousal level. Any effective step within it is accompanied by the formation of a *felt sense* (experience), and the formation of this experience often promotes the renewal and expansion of cognitive schemas. This series of steps holds no special mystery; they are things that survivors need to learn and *can* learn, but for people with high emotional intelligence, they are simply customary. Therefore, these steps do not introduce additional compensation or self-inhibition; they are both the steps of self-rescue and the steps of mental training. The manner in which these steps are described fully conforms to the requirements of the spectrum view.

#### Acquiring Flow

When the subject's Body, Mind, and Intellect enter an active and synchronous state, the subject experiences a "sense of flow." CBT starts from cognition, whereas the Feldenkrais Method and SE start from somatic sensation (proprioception) to help the subject obtain this sense of flow.

Positive life experiences (especially those related to overcoming challenges) are an important resource library for awakening experiences. Survivors who lack positive life experiences or are too severely traumatized can use the "Awareness Through Movement" (ATM) of the Feldenkrais Method to achieve Body-Mind-Intellect synchronicity at a relatively low arousal level, and then use "Focusing" to anchor and expand this new experience. The anchoring and expansion of experience means carrying this newly acquired *felt sense* and, without destroying that *felt sense*, proceeding with activities that were originally restricted, thereby expanding one's capacity for activity. This has a bit of a Zen practice flavor, but it is completely different from the Zen practice of isolating oneself from society.

The Feldenkrais Method is widely used in posture correction, sports rehabilitation, and psychotherapy. In psychotherapy, it is an important auxiliary tool for SE. It helps the subject expand their somatic awareness and explore entirely new mind-body positions (states) in a relatively calm state. Only by making survivors aware that their mind-body state can have other possibilities, and letting them experience what these new states feel like, can they possibly know the direction of their efforts.

The Feldenkrais Method includes Awareness Through Movement and Functional Integration; this article only focuses on ATM. ATM requires the subject to concentrate their attention on the changes in somatic sensation as movement occurs ("somatic sensation" and "change in somatic sensation" are synonyms; somatic sensation itself implies change). This includes the somatic sensations directly generated by the significant activity that is the focus of attention, the somatic sensations generated by micro-activity, and also the somatic sensations generated by the change of the body's overall state relative to external space. Therefore, the specific movement is just a "handle"; through this light, small, and slow way of moving, the subject can quickly grasp the feeling of mindfulness. This mindful state of consciousness will run through the entire process of self-rescue.

At a lower arousal level, self-conflict is hidden, just as an extremely relaxed posture cannot expose problems with muscle coordination. Therefore, extremely gentle ATM is only a starting point. Once the subject can experience a sense of flow from the activity, they should continuously increase the activity intensity, enabling the subject to maintain the same awareness at a higher activity intensity. As the activity intensity increases, the arousal level will gradually rise. Maintaining that same awareness prevents the subject from falling into a freeze or dissociation when the arousal level rises. Only at a higher arousal level and higher activity level can the subject identify and break through self-inhibition. This is actually similar to the basketball example, only it requires neither complex social situations nor any professional skill.

SE carries certain risks for severely traumatized individuals, so the "titration" technique must be used. Titration refers to carefully and slowly approaching the painful feelings that emerged during the survival process, to prevent suffering secondary trauma during the process of healing the trauma. Titration embodies the idea of "slow motion," which is the core of "Awareness Through Movement." Titration is similar to the approach of Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, only it is gentler and places more emphasis on evoking the subject's flexibility, letting the subject realize that when facing pressure, they have more natural and powerful choices besides freezing.

#### Attending to One's Own Drive

The awakening experience is not unfamiliar to anyone; it is just that these experiences are often fleeting and rarely utilized. A subject in an "awakening moment" is like a piece of iron heated red-hot. Unfortunately, long-term paralysis means the subject's drives are severely depleted; they seldom realize the need to "strike while the iron is hot." Every time they try to follow their drive and break through self-inhibition, emotions like shame and fear occupy their thoughts until the awakening experience fades.

Helping the subject find their internal resources within the acute stress event, especially internal resources that reflect the subject's social connections, can promote the subject's awareness of their own drives. Social connection is the most powerful connection. Important internal resources are often related to intimate relationships and experiences of blending. Only by fully connecting to internal resources can the subject possibly withstand the intense negative emotions during the process of breaking through self-inhibition.

For severely traumatized individuals, the "sense of flow" brought by the awakening is itself attractive enough to make the subject strive to remain active. The subject feels that activities which are usually strenuous become efficient and fluid. They find they can both maintain sufficient attention on their interaction partner and maintain a complete perception of the environment. The subject will, on the one hand, strive to maintain this state of consciousness, and on the other hand, feel an inexplicable fear. This "twisted/screwed-up" feeling fully exposes the self-inhibition.

For an ordinary person, the process of attending to one's own drive is the process of initially confirming the relationship between the stress event and oneself.

#### Dialogue between Body and Mind

After self-inhibition is exposed, the subject must leave enough space and time for the dialogue between the body and the intellect, to ensure that they can form a *felt sense* (experience) while breaking through the self-inhibition.

Think about you diligently exploring in a predicament, only to be suddenly "backstabbed" by a trusted object. The new orienting response creates a strong impulse to explore backward, but the current exploration process is extremely urgent and cannot be interrupted. The intense conflict between different impulses traps you in a state where you can neither advance nor retreat. If you possess sufficient activity level and timely notice the abnormality in the trusted object, you will feel a strong and clear sense of crisis at this moment. You will take appropriate action to restrain the impulse to explore backward, allowing the forward exploration to advance stably, and at an appropriate time, you will turn back to resolve the backward exploration problem. In this scenario, you have sufficient awareness of this restraint. If your activity level is very poor, or if you fall into a clumsy "vulnerable state" because the exploration is too difficult, you will struggle to notice this "adding insult to injury" event. You only vaguely feel that you have suddenly become more vulnerable. At this time, you experience intense and chaotic fear, anger, or shame. Under the impact of this huge energy, your exploratory impulse is subconsciously blocked. You feel you have suddenly lost the motivation to continue exploring. In this scenario, you have no control whatsoever over this self-inhibition. Thus, conflicting impulses do not directly cause trauma; passive self-inhibition is the key to causing trauma.

SE believes that the degradation of activity level comes from unconscious self-inhibition. Just as CBT believes that cognition determines emotion, mainstream psychotherapy techniques all emphasize the responsibility the subject bears for their current predicament.

Under the attention quality of mindfulness, ideas/thoughts/whims are not independent entities; rather, they are the naming and interpretation of emotions and somatic perceptions. Thoughts are always accompanied by all sorts of somatic experiences. The more vivid the experience, the more concrete the thought. In anthropomorphic terms, there is an innate dialogue capability (i.e., "self-organizational power") between a person's intellect and body. Human willpower does not exist to fight against the body's inopportune impulses; it exists to provide a sufficiently vast space and sufficient energy for the various impulses within the body, enabling the body to produce appropriate behaviors. A person who is adept at experiencing (felt sense) can maintain a balance between their thoughts and their somatic experiences, and a balance between self-awareness and environmental awareness. Simply put, they fully respect their own "internal dialogue" capability. They will maintain the rhythm of various interactions at a level that both ensures the interaction proceeds stably and allows their own experience to be relatively complete. For them, conflicts in life always promote the renewal of cognitive schemas rather than causing passive self-inhibition. Such people always give the impression of being calm and steady; they are always able to lead the rhythm of the interaction.

For an ordinary person, the dialogue between body and mind is the process of inspiration continuously emerging and differentiation (slicing the problem) being continuously completed during exploration.

#### Breaking Through Self-Inhibition

Experience (felt sense) is the product of mutual communication and conflict resolution between Body, Mind, and Intellect. In self-conflict, the stronger the emotions like fear and shame, the longer the time needed to form an experience. During the formation of the experience, the subject must strive to maintain the stability of their arousal, enabling themselves to fully contain these emotions. If the subject ultimately overcomes the fear and, at the somatic experience level, separates the mutually conflicting impulses, the experience is formed. This mental confrontation, just like physical confrontation, may cause your body to tremble involuntarily. **Trembling signifies the breakthrough of self-inhibition**; it signifies that the suspended stress process has been completed.

At the cognitive level, the process of separating mutually conflicting impulses is the process of narrative restoration and narrative reconstruction. All maladaptive response patterns and mind-body states were originally adaptive. Finding the situation that matches these response patterns or states is also a means of narrative restoration.

When the subject finds it difficult to maintain what is, in an ordinary person's eyes, a relaxed and expanded posture (assuming it's not due to excessive fatigue), they can try to adjust themselves to the most comfortable posture possible at that moment. (In other words, the subject must respect their own comfortable but improper postures.) Then, carefully observe this posture (one can videotape it first) and search in the mind for a situation that matches it. For example, a posture of hunched chest, rounded back, and forward head is seen as a sign of a subordinate. But, if you are an unarmed civilian under the fire of war, and you must risk your life to go out and retrieve something, you would naturally be in this posture. The difference is that in this scenario, the posture is full of energy, not limp. If you have not experienced war, you can imagine another situation that is vivid enough for you. The purpose of the imagination is to promote arousal and inject energy into this posture. When you feel your body is full of energy, you can then act like the other people in that situation—looking around, observing sharply, probing carefully. When you are able to confirm from the sensory information you acquire that the danger no longer exists, the body will naturally return to a more expanded posture. This kind of expansion is a natural, energized expansion, not a rigidly forced "straightening." At this point, you have gained another "awakening" experience.

People spend most of their time in study and work repeating similar and highly restricted activity patterns, which prevents the body's activity level from being fully released. The reason some alternative medicines occasionally demonstrate bizarre efficacy is often that the implementation of these therapies breaks the subject's daily behavioral patterns. Take acupuncture as an example: the patient must cooperate with the practitioner, constantly adjusting their posture, consciously tightening or relaxing specific body parts. These are often postures the patient does not frequently use in daily life. This can often cause the subject to stumble back into their neutral state, activating the body's activity level and indirectly improving the function of the immune system. In reality, as long as we conduct conscious, rhythmic, and systematic physical activation and muscle stretching—for example, persisting in a moderate-intensity night run (or morning run), followed by slow, meticulous muscle stretching with the dynamic quality of ATM—we can achieve a similar effect. It is worth noting that when survivors first learn to stretch, they often tend to reflexively tense the relevant muscles, resisting true relaxation, making the stretch ineffective. For them, relaxation means letting down their guard, and letting down their guard always means being harmed. Therefore, a seemingly simple stretch is actually a major challenge for them. The participant must maintain sufficient patience with themselves, use deep breathing to alleviate tension, carefully perceive their body state, and little by little, let go of this parasitic tension and feel the peace brought by relaxation. The subject should cherish the emotional flashbacks that occur during the practice; this is an excellent opportunity to identify self-inhibition.

The author John Elder Robison in *Switched On* (a recommended book at the end of the text) had an experience of being accidentally awakened after participating in a Transcranial Magnetic Simulation (TMS) experiment. This was likely related to his accidental return to a neutral state during the experiment. He keenly "focused" on the changes occurring in his phenomenological world. Because he had not suffered excessive harm from traumatized caregivers, his traumatization at the cognitive schema level was not severe. This made him one of the rare few who entered a self-sustaining state of awakening after only a single "enlightenment."

After self-inhibition is broken through, fear is transformed into inspiration. For an ordinary person, the process of breaking through self-inhibition is the process of releasing confrontation and returning to the neutral state. When the subject breaks through self-inhibition, they also lift the limitations that the residue of the stress event imposed on their perceptual abilities. Complete and flexible perception and the orienting capability are restored. The quality of this process directly displays a person's psychological fortitude.

### Tools: Physical Confrontation Training and Muscle Release

#### The Meaning of Confrontation

The value of physical confrontation ability training for survivors cannot be ignored. Trauma causes the intellect to lose its connection with somatic sensation. Physical confrontation training (boxing, wrestling, etc.) requires the subject to pay accurate, real-time attention to the physical states of both parties, maintaining a constant dialogue with their own body. There is absolutely no time for micro-management. This is conducive to rebuilding the synchronicity of intellect and body. Boxing and wrestling teach people, in a safe manner, how to release aggression while maintaining control.

This type of training needs to be conducted under the guidance of professionals.

#### Muscle Strengthening and Release

A fragile body makes survivors very susceptible to injury during physical confrontation. Therefore, before cultivating physical confrontation ability, it is necessary to complete basic strength training, bringing one's strength at least to the level of an ordinary person. Survivors commonly have physical deficits; in the initial stages of training, they must pay attention to transitions and avoid easily exceeding their limits. One must ensure that they are in a state where excitement outweighs pain upon completing each training session. If unexpected pain occurs, the exact cause must be found; seek professional help if necessary. One must absolutely avoid a situation of training for one month only to be forced to rest for two.

Many survivors discover during training that certain strengths they possess are exceptionally powerful. For example, some people cannot do a single push-up yet can easily hold a 10-minute horse stance. A long-term posture of being hunched and unexpanded causes the muscles on the front of their thighs to become excessively tight; this is precisely the physical manifestation of vulnerability. These excessively tight muscles all need to be sufficiently released. The safest and most effective methods for releasing muscles are stretching and massage.

Muscle strengthening and muscle release must receive equal attention and must not be biased. Otherwise, it may lead to adverse consequences.

### Tools: Nutritional Adjustments

Long-term stress disorders can cause dysfunction in the digestive and immune systems, leading to imbalances in brain chemistry. Nutritional factors cannot be ignored for CPTSD.
