## Preface

### The Feasibility of Self-Help

First, let's imagine an ideal situation: everyone can use functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and other technologies to monitor their corresponding brain activity in real-time while engaged in a specific psychological activity. By comparing this to the brain activity of an average person in a similar situation, we could assess our own psychological health and guide our own adjustments.

Although the above scenario is not realistic, subjectively, different brain activities correspond to different phenomenological experiences and cognitive schemas. Due to various factors, even in similar situations, the experiences produced by the same individual at different times can vary in quality. Therefore, differences in brain activity patterns can be self-assessed through differences in the quality of phenomenological experience. Although individuals with Asperger's Syndrome and Complex PTSD survivors (hereafter "survivors," provided it causes no ambiguity) have their own limitations, they still possess a considerable degree of social functioning. They have the ability to make relatively objective self-assessments through observation and learning, especially through learning in social activities.

Compared to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), although Complex PTSD (CPTSD) is more complex pathologically, the associated traumatic events are often relatively milder. It is easier for the individual to bear the various painful emotions aroused during the process of dealing with the trauma.

These conditions make self-help healing possible.

### The Necessity of Self-Help

Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and Complex PTSD (CPTSD) share a significant degree of commonality. This article focuses on helping the individual achieve transformation and does not intend to make a clear distinction between the two. In practice, the distinction between the two is highly subjective: if a treatment method for a survivor works for an individual with Asperger's, people will assume the previous diagnosis was incorrect; if all treatment methods fail for a survivor, people will suspect that the survivor is an individual with Asperger's. The richness of their connotations and the diversity and complexity of their manifestations make modern medical interventions feel like "scratching an itch from outside the boot," finding it difficult to be effective. Meanwhile, related psychological counseling methods generally involve long cycles, high costs, and poor results. Even if they are effective, the transfer of therapeutic effects gained from the counseling relationship to life situations is a problem, given that the mental development level of survivors is generally lagging. For adults with Asperger's Syndrome and survivors, self-help is almost the only reliable means.

The resolution of psychological disorders relies on good social relationships, but survivors and individuals with AS often severely lack the ability to develop meaningful relationships with others. If they are forcibly pushed into various complex social environments (similar to the approach of exposure therapy), it will not only be unhelpful for growth but may also cause secondary harm. In reality, the early stages of self-healing can be carried out in relatively simple social situations or even in peaceful solitude. Only after some stubborn, foundational problems have been addressed can social-level support fully play its role. This article focuses on methods for handling these foundational problems.

### The Basic Approach

For young survivors, treatment must begin with rebuilding attachment. This requires the joint participation of the person concerned, caregivers, and professionals, which is beyond the scope of this article. This article primarily serves survivors who have already stumbled into adulthood.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) holds an absolutely dominant position in the field of PTSD treatment. Among its methods, Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PET) are the most widely used. However, when CBT is applied to CPTSD, the results are less than satisfactory.

Trauma treatment techniques that focus on somatic experience emerged from Gestalt Therapy. Among these, Peter Levine's Somatic Experiencing (SE) approach is the most well-known. CBT starts with cognitive schemas and behavioral habits to drive a shift in mind-body states. But CPTSD requires more complex and subtle processing, necessitating the use of many special conceptual tools and practical techniques. Somatic Experiencing, which enters through somatic experience, perfectly compensates for the shortcomings of CBT. From a CBT perspective, SE operates much like a specially packaged version of CPT and PET. It is centered on the specific case, fully attentive to subtle, hard-to-express details, and requires extreme patience and focus. This article is concerned precisely with this supplementary role that SE plays for CBT.

In China, CBT and psychodynamics are relatively popular, while the mass foundation for Somatic Experiencing is relatively weak. Therefore, this article will use more space to introduce concepts and ideas related to SE and will not dwell on CBT and psychodynamics; relevant materials can be obtained from the recommended book list at the end of the text.

Similar to fever and coughing, ADHD and Asperger's Syndrome are crude collections of symptoms rather than standardized pathological labels. This article, based on the positive psychology view of difference (see Section 1.4) and the SE view of the mind-body (see Section 1.5), understands the essence of ADHD and Asperger's as a "vulnerability." Due to severe disturbances in the early developmental process, the individual is in a "vulnerable state" from the very beginning of life. This state makes them extremely susceptible to various injuries during their early life explorations; their body itself may even be a source of trauma (see Section 3.10). The traumatization process for individuals with Asperger's begins in early childhood, or even earlier life stages. After long-term progression and compensation, it forms a complex and chaotic tangle of manifestations. Self-help for Asperger's should be based on self-help for CPTSD. Compared to the "neurodiversity paradigm" and the "pathology paradigm," this article's understanding of Asperger's can be summarized as the "social relations paradigm."

Provided it does not cause ambiguity, this article will refer to psychological trauma simply as trauma. But we will soon see that psychological trauma and physical trauma share a great deal of homology. A vulnerable psyche and a vulnerable body are twin brothers.

This article is neither a nanny-style tutorial nor a dictionary-style manual. It is merely a sharing of the author's own knowledge reserve and personal experience. It is hoped that it can bring some help to those in need, and also that it can offer ordinary people a glimpse into the phenomenological world (sometimes called "subjective reality") of trauma survivors, thereby fostering a bit more understanding and tolerance.

### A Note to the Listener

The main text is approximately 140,000 Chinese characters, divided into seven chapters. To keep the writing concise, this article will not elaborate on concepts (such as the definitions of stress disorders, CPTSD, etc.) or cases that are already explained in detail in the required reading list at the end of the text. This may create reading difficulty for readers lacking a foundation in psychology or those with attention deficits due to severe traumatization. This difficulty is, in a sense, necessary and can be understood as an intentional challenge set by the author. These required readings (see Sections 7.1-7.6) are by no means optional embellishments for this article. If you cannot get through this material, it is likely that this article will also not suit your taste. Among them, the two books marked with a â˜… are the direct source of this article's ideas; without them, this article would not exist.

CPTSD is different from PTSD. For PTSD survivors, the content of this article may be overly tedious and of limited significance.

Self-rescue from CPTSD is a serious, lengthy, and extremely challenging task. Knowledge reserves, life experience, learning ability, patience, determination, and perceptiveness are all indispensable. Only those who firmly believe they possess these abilities can save themselves. The journey beyond trauma is like a rebirth; many people will gain a higher state of mind as a result. As the saying goes, no effort is ever in vain. This article is not suitable for those seeking a quick fix or for those who are merely troubled by daily trifles.

The content of the article contains hypothetical components; chapters with a larger hypothetical component will be specially noted. The ultimate standard for testing truth is practice, not authority. A diagnosis that cannot offer a solution is of little meaning to the person concerned. Regarding the scientific nature of psychotherapy theories, the person concerned and the researcher have an equal right to speak; the relationship between them is one of equal cooperation.

Except for quoted passages, this article is an original work. Please observe relevant norms when reprinting or citing.

## Chapter 1: The Foundation: Understanding the Self and Trauma

### The View of Human Nature

This article does not discuss antisocial personality.

Prosociality is a human instinct. The reason ordinary people prefer socializing is not that their prosocial instincts are stronger, but that they have accumulated abundant positive interactive experiences in life. If a person has never established a meaningful emotional connection with others, they cannot know what loneliness is, much less actively resist it. This does not mean, however, that they will not suffer its effects. For example, children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (or other pervasive developmental disorders) commonly exhibit autonomic nervous system dysfunction, low immunity, abnormal arousal levels, and difficulty regulating attention. To a large extent, these problems are caused by long-term loneliness.

The goal of psychotherapy is to fully unfurl the individual's own nature, not to pursue some "ideal personality." If an individual's ability to express love is limited, it is only because they have been deeply hurt.

### The View of Responsibility (Self-Responsibility, Struggle, Protracted Struggle)

#### The Spirit of Self-Responsibility

Trauma and deficits are not one's own fault, but one must take ultimate responsibility for one's own rescue. Only by seeing one's own responsibility clearly can one see the agency and influence one possesses. "Taking responsibility for oneself" is absolutely not "blaming the victim." Responsibility absolutely does not mean "taking the blame" or being humiliated.

Although many survivors' misfortunes are related to physiological defects, family of origin, or their developmental environment, these factors all belong to life's "initial settings." The first step in walking out of trauma's shadow is to reconcile with one's "initial settings." Reconciliation is not forgiveness, and it is certainly not an indictment; it is truly seeing the complete picture of growth. Only those who can grasp this point can possibly achieve self-rescue.

Cultivating a spirit of self-responsibility first requires completing the identity shift from "victim" to "survivor." One must shift the core focus from "what injuries have I suffered?" to "how have I managed to endure until today?" and "what more can I do?"

The healing process will evoke a large amount of anger. Survivors must firmly remember the principle: "Hate the act, not the person." Both forgiveness and indictment are irrelevant to healing; they are matters to be re-evaluated by the individual, using their complete cognitive abilities, *after* healing is complete. We feel anger in order to reclaim the inner strength we abandoned, not to attribute the cause of our lost strength to others' deprivation. Attributing the cause to others is tantamount to admitting that others can control our healing process, which is undoubtedly a self-defeating act.

#### The Spirit of Total Struggle

If trauma is like a wound on a tree, CPTSD is the scattered dead branches and fallen leaves after the tree, covered in wounds, has fallen. The treatment process for CPTSD is neither a simple process of treating wounds nor a simple process of cleaning up trash; it is the process of growing a new, great tree upon the remains of the old trunk. Survivors must shed the illusion of "patching things up for another three years" and prepare for a total metamorphosis (shedding one's skin and changing one's bones). Only when survivors realize they have no path of retreat left, that all means of escape have thoroughly failed, can they move toward awakening. Otherwise, they can easily fall into self-pity during the self-rescue process.

#### The Spirit of Protracted Struggle

Extreme reactions are always closely linked to the isolation of an event. When facing trouble, if a person believes they will never encounter it a second time, they will likely either stake everything on one throw, overdrafting themselves, or do nothing at all, merely closing their eyes and praying it passes quickly. But if they believe this trouble will become a frequent visitor, and that ignoring it will subject them to more and more limitations, they will adopt a completely different attitude. Those who can walk out of the shadow of trauma understand the weight of the word "maneuver" (to deal with something tactfully, to circle around it) far better than ordinary people.

The self-rescue from CPTSD is a spiral upward; it cannot be accomplished overnight. Each new cycle in the process requires enduring greater pressure than the last, while simultaneously having more resources to utilize. After the cycle ends, the individual reaps more vitality and a more profound peace. During this cyclical process, the individual's mind and body, starting from scattered debris, gradually form larger fragments, and finally merge into a unified whole.

Each cycle is a process of "enlightenment," "awakening," or "ascending a dimension." It is completed naturally after the individual's truest life force is released. Psychotherapy exists to help us unfurl our natural disposition and rediscover confidence from the "sense of flow" in life, not to make us meticulously cautious.

### The Social Relations Paradigm (Nature vs. Nurture)

#### The Nature vs. Nurture View

The human as a biological organism and the human as a social individual are not on the same level. This concept can be understood through the relationship between "software systems" and "hardware systems" in computer science. Early computer systems did not deliberately distinguish "software" and "hardware." As systems grew more complex, people began describing them from these two dimensions. Although the software system is based on the hardware system, their conceptual systems and terminologies are independent. The software system cannot be simply reduced to the hardware system. A computer's operation process can be described from both the hardware perspective and the software perspective; both descriptions are self-consistent. The two cannot be simply mapped structurally, and we cannot logically force a causal relationship between them. The relationship between them is complex, not linear. Similarly, the concepts used to describe human capabilities (especially social capabilities) cannot be simply mapped to the anatomical structures or material components of the human body (including the brain).

For example, people once thought the brain's occipital lobe was responsible for visual function. But as technology advanced, it was discovered that the occipital lobes of blind individuals are also highly active, leading to the understanding that the occipital lobe is responsible for spatial recognition function. Later, it was found that the occipital lobe alone cannot form a complete spatial perception, nor does it only function during spatial recognition. Today, scientists' understanding of the brain has developed to a very abstract level, and a series of unique conceptual systems, detached from everyday language, is forming.

But we do not need to feel pressured by this. Just as a software engineer does not need to know the infinite details of the hardware's working processes, nor will they rashly demand hardware changes just because their own ability is insufficient, we do not need to learn endless neurobiology or neurochemistry to understand and process our trauma. This is of little significance to self-help, and pharmaceutical or physical interventions often carry risk. Researchers rigidly distinguish between "innate factors" and "postnatal factors," "endogenous factors" and "external factors," mainly to delineate responsibilityâ€”to clearly define the boundaries between "non-intervenable" and "intervenable," "physiochemical intervention" and "cognitive intervention," in order to answer the question: "Can it be intervened, and who intervenes?" The answer to this question concerns the vested interests of the researcher (the observer), but it holds almost no value for the person concerned.

If we compare the physiological basis of a psychological disorder to a hen, and the abnormal cognitive schemas and behavioral habits to an egg (this analogy is used considering it is easier for a hen to lay an egg than an egg to hatch a hen), then the formation of the disorder is the process of the hen laying the egg and the egg hatching the hen until the chicken coop is bursting. The primary goal of intervention is to break this cycle, not to worry about whether there were initially more eggs or more hens. From the individual's own perspective, the formation of any psychological disorder is the result of both innate and postnatal factors working together. Emotional intelligence, like muscle, is both innate and trained; it is developed subconsciously through various activities, and it can also be developed through conscious exercise. The discussion of nature versus nurture has limited significance in self-help healing.

#### The Social Relations Model and Neurophysiological Model

The essence of psychological problems is various forms of "alienation." Psychological problems can only be most comprehensively understood and accurately intervened with within a social relations framework. The observation, understanding, and intervention of psychological problems depend on the most subtle details within specific interactions. Psychological problems are the internalization of social relationship problems. Differences at the neurophysiological level do not directly determine differences in an individual's adaptive capacity. Over-focusing on neurophysiological factors risks mistaking the branch for the root. Discussing the abstract nature of psychological problems detached from the specific individual is of limited significance. Survivors should not use "innate traits cannot be changed" as an excuse to evade responsibility.

This passage concentrates the core thinking of the "social relations paradigm." Psychological intervention models developed based on this paradigm all belong to the social relations model. In contrast, intervention models that primarily attribute the cause and intervention methods of psychological problems to neurophysiological factors belong to the neurophysiological model. CBT is based on the social relations model. Somatic Experiencing and Sensorimotor Psychotherapy pursue a unification of the social relations model and the neurophysiological model. Given the current developmental level of psychological intervention techniques, all effective interventions are inseparable from the social relations model. This article primarily uses the social relations paradigm to understand various psychological problems and will not involve much neurophysiological knowledge.

### The Positive Psychology and Spectrum View (Moving Beyond Labels)

This article views the differences between individuals with psychological disorders and ordinary people through the lens of Positive Psychology's view of difference. This view can be summarized as the "View of Great Similarity, Minor Difference" and the "Spectrum View," with the former being the foundation for the latter.

#### The View of Great Similarity, Minor Difference

Humanity possesses both uniformity and diversity, with uniformity being the dominant factor. This is why humankind can possess rich possibilities yet still exist as a whole. Significant uniformity often contains subtle differences, and significant differences also contain widespread uniformity. No matter how much we focus on the differences between those with psychological disorders and ordinary people, these differences and divisions are secondary and subtle. The commonalities and connections between people are universal and primary; it is just that people, driven by a desire for novelty, are more willing to focus on that small point of difference.

#### The Spectrum View

The spectrum view opposes labeling.

So-called normal and abnormal are merely opposing labels that people forcibly apply to the same manifestation at different degrees, simply out of laziness. For instance, Social Darwinists simplistically divide humanity into the strong and the weak, defining social relations as "competition," and from then on, never need to concern themselves with human diversity or the complexity of social activities. A valuable description ought to be able to cover all phenomena within the same spectrumâ€”from typical to atypical, or from general to specificâ€”rather than describing them separately first and then adding extra explanations about their correlations, which only creates artificial divisions.

For example, this article interprets the survivor's abnormal mind-body state as the individual's "habitual state" significantly deviating from the recognized "optimal state." Ordinary people also have various deviations, but these deviations are not significant and can be adjusted or compensated for unconsciously without consuming extra cognitive resources, nor do they produce obvious discomfort. As another example, many CPTSD survivors are accustomed to dividing conscious objects into internal objects and external objects, which reveals a certain sense of fragmentation. But even so, their primary experience of the world is the same as that of ordinary people. Even ordinary people sometimes identify with this division, because they, too, experience these states of consciousness, it just doesn't cause them significant maladaptation. For convenience of expression, this article will sometimes use "internal" and "external" to distinguish things, but they must be viewed from the stance of the spectrum view.

Compulsive behaviors and reflexive behaviors can also be seen as existing on the same spectrum; the only difference is that the activation conditions underpinning the former are relatively strict and thus more easily perceived and regulated. Conditioned reflexes, unconditioned reflexes, and operant conditioning can also be seen as existing on the same spectrum. A conditioned reflex is a sequential behavior formed with an unconditioned reflex as its core component, combined with matching elements. A conditioned reflex that includes significant operational behavior is operant conditioning. Operant conditioning that has developed into a hard-wired connection over long-term evolution is an unconditioned reflex.

#### Diagnostic Labels from a Spectrum View

An appropriate label can turn indescribable suffering into a shareable meaning. The individual can use this as a starting point to seek relevant resources and strive to change their situation. This is the true meaning of a label. Labels should be understood as an "index," not an "identity."

The reality, however, is that labels often lead to people being "labeled." Some are marginalized because of a label, subjected to all kinds of "special treatment." Many parents completely lose faith in their children simply because they were labeled "Asperger's." Some people, because of a label, obsessively seek out so-called "kindred spirits" to find psychological comfort. The person becomes alienated, an appendage to the label, and thus loses the possibility of change.

If a person's traits in one area are too prominent, it is easy for them to see others with similar traits as being of the same kind, completely ignoring other, more fundamental and important qualities. Children are often keen on seeking identity confirmation. Once they are labeled "Asperger's," they are more likely to flock together with other people bearing special labels, which undoubtedly introduces new risks to their development.

#### Self-Help from a Spectrum View

Psychological self-help is not acting as one's own counselor; that is completely unrealistic.

The social environment is full of potential trauma sources. Our immunity and self-healing power determine the impact they have on us. From this perspective, it seems survivors should learn from those with strong immunity and self-healing abilities. Unfortunately, however, the phenomenological world of these "strong ones" is too different from that of survivors, so much so that it is difficult to express them appropriately within the same linguistic system. Ordinary people cannot understand why survivors are so fragile, and survivors cannot understand how ordinary people can use trauma to achieve growth.

The value of a self-help theory lies in constructing a scientific linguistic system that can encompass the phenomenological worlds of both survivors and ordinary people. On one hand, it allows survivors to experience the phenomenological world of ordinary people and understand their immunity and self-healing power, thereby clarifying the direction and methods for their own efforts. On the other hand, it allows ordinary people to experience the phenomenological world of survivors, understand their vulnerability, and thus find it easier to get along with them.

Self-rescue is not about developing a series of special skills to compensate for one's deficits; it is about helping the survivor exercise the "psychological muscles" that have atrophied due to trauma. Take "mindfulness" as an example. People with high emotional intelligence generally possess the ability to integrate their various feelings without being swept away by a single, intense emotion, but they never emphasize this ability of theirs. In the eyes of a survivor, they seem to possess a sort of "divine power." By introducing the concept of "mindfulness," fully explaining its meaning, and demonstrating its various applications, we can help survivors cultivate this ability, thereby helping them achieve post-traumatic growth.

Compared to physiological defects, psychological disorders have strong heterogeneity. Rather than saying it is difficult to find a common physiological basis for psychological disorders, it is better to say they have no common physiological basis at all. Each person's "pathology" may be unique. This is one reason the "pathology paradigm" is so controversial. Psychological disorders require individualized intervention plans. Devising individualized intervention plans requires a linguistic system capable of bridging different phenomenological worlds. It is like learning to drive a car: we must first recognize the brake, the accelerator, and so on. If we hit the road without knowing these basic configurations, we will only cause a traffic accident.

Life is full of dark humor. Sometimes a single, simple problem can trap a person for a lifetime. Many psychological dilemmas seem unsolvable only because they are difficult to articulate properly within existing linguistic systems. Since they cannot be clearly explained, the person concerned can only resign themselves to fate, attributing the problem to some "innate defect." An appropriate linguistic systemâ€”one that can bridge the phenomenological worlds of ordinary people and those with psychological disordersâ€”can help us locate our coordinates on a sufficiently vast and detailed map, thereby finding the way home. As a valuable self-help theory, its language must function as a "signpost," a "bridge," and an "interpreter." A theory that cannot point the way for those who are trapped is just a decorative vase, no matter how exquisite.

The best candidates for this work are those who have lived in two (or more) completely different phenomenological worlds and who possess a certain degree of academic literacy and expressive ability. In human history, the "border people" who traveled between different communities often became the earliest "translators"; they made important contributions to the spread and development of civilization.

The author of this text has had the fortune of traveling back and forth between the phenomenological worlds of CPTSD survivors and ordinary people. May this article serve as a catalyst, awakening more people to the importance of the survivor's phenomenological world.

### The Integrated Mind-Body View (The Core Somatic Model)

#### The Integrated Body-Brain View

Somatic Experiencing does not intentionally distinguish between brain activity and body activity. Any specific activity simultaneously involves the activity of all parts of the body, including the brain. The brain's activity can be indirectly observed through the body's micro-activities. The "body (flesh)" mentioned in this article always includes the brain.

Even a protozoan like a paramecium clearly displays certain qualities unique to living organisms in its daily activities. When we observe the life of a paramecium, we unconsciously experience emotions similar to those we feel when observing higher animals. This emotion cannot be explained by "projection," because we rarely have this feeling no matter how complex the mechanical motion we observe. This article does not intend to explore the essence of life, but only to use this as an entry point into the hierarchical model of the mind commonly used in modern psychotherapy.

From the limbs to the brain, and from the brain's lower cortex to its higher cortex, it is not a case of the former being subordinate to the latter, or the lower serving the higher. On the contrary, the former is the premise, foundation, source, and destination of the latter. The latter is the enhancement, expansion, and integration of the former. The latter comes from the former and returns to the former; its reason for existence is to make the energy flow of the former more efficient and smooth, thereby unleashing higher creativity. This body-brain relationship view can be called the "Integrated Body-Brain View." It unifies the evolutionary history of the species with the developmental process of the individual, and unifies lower-level instinctive activities with higher-level cognitive activities. It allows us to understand the underlying logic of higher animal life activities by observing the life activities of lower animals; to understand the internal dynamics of adult activities by observing the activities of children; and to know what is happening in the brain through the explicit information displayed by bodily activity.

"Instinct," "emotion," and "cognition" are all products of body-brain integration, with the degree of integration increasing in that order. In daily context, people often use "body" to refer to instinct. "Integration" is a slightly awkward term; emotion and cognition cannot be simply reduced to physiological activity, so terms like "integration" and "emergence" must be used to vaguely express the mind-body relationship. Although integration is abstract, "plucking up courage" is familiar to everyone. The process of plucking up courage is a kind of spontaneous integration. All self-help strategies are ultimately aimed at helping the individual "pluck up courage" in the most natural way.

#### The Integrated Body-Mind View

Behavior is the integrated result of instinct, emotion, and cognition.

The relationship between instinct ("Body" or "Reptilian Brain"), emotion ("Mind" or "Lower Mammalian Brain"), and cognition ("Intellect" or "Neocortex") can be analogized to the body-brain relationship described above. This view of the psyche can be called the "Integrated Body-Mind View." It unifies the evolutionary history of the species, the developmental process of the individual, and the process of specific behaviors, giving it extremely strong explanatory and guiding significance. It allows us to use the language of the body and life (the explicit information displayed by the body and life) to tell the story of the psyche (the phenomenological world). The "Body" is both the physical body and the so-called "subconscious"; it is directly unified with the external environment. Body and Mind constitute the "Child Self"; Body, Mind, and Intellect together constitute the "Adult Self."

This model can be analogized to the neural reflexes involved in defecation. Body, Mind, and Intellect can be sequentially analogized to lower-level and higher-level central command centers.

#### Two Kinds of Growth

The Child Self is the foundation of the Adult Self; therefore, we can also use children's activities to understand the underlying logic of adult activities. Our various manifestations during childhood do not simply disappear or change with age; on the contrary, they become the foundation for more complex behaviors and cognitive processes. When we encounter extreme situations and all these complex behaviors and cognitive processes fail, we are forced to start processing problems again from a very basic level. At this time, our childhood behavioral style will clearly manifest, and even images from childhood may flash through our minds. This phenomenon is known in psychodynamics as "regression."

Growth is both a process of constantly reshaping basic sequential behaviors and cognitive schemas, and a process of developing more complex habits and cognitive schemas. The former is the **First Kind of Growth**, and the latter is the **Second Kind of Growth**. The First Kind of Growth usually occurs in a state where the individual's practical ability far exceeds their cognitive ability, characterized significantly by "action before knowing." The growth discussed by adults is mainly the Second Kind of Growth; "the unity of knowing and acting" is the basic requirement of the Second Kind of Growth. An ordinary person's First Kind of Growth is basically complete by late adolescence. Its adaptive significance is to enable the individual to face the various impacts of social reality from a relatively independent stance, allowing the Second Kind of Growth to reach a very high level. The survivor's First Kind of Growth was never completed. This both allows their personality to exhibit good plasticity even in adulthood and also makes their Second Kind of Growth extremely unstable. The vast majority of a survivor's abnormal manifestations can be seen as the product of severe deficiency in the First Kind of Growth and excessive compensation by the Second Kind of Growth.

The transformation of impulse into action usually follows two paths: the "Impulse -> Action -> Observation and Experience -> Improved Action" path, and the "Impulse -> Self-Inhibition -> Analysis and Thought -> Action" path. The former belongs to the First Kind of Growth, the latter to the Second Kind of Growth. The former is the prerequisite and foundation for the latter; the latter is the supplement and expansion of the former. The former can be analogized to a child learning their mother tongue; the latter can be analogized to an ordinary person learning a foreign language. (This analogy is somewhat crude, as learning clearly does not equal growth. Growth implies an evolution from simple to complex, from potential to reality, from mutable to stable.) The more sufficient the First Kind of Growth, the greater the space for the Second Kind of Growth, and the greater the individual's "potential." If survivors wish to develop their capacity for action, they must, through diligent practice, make up for the First Kind of Growth that was left behind.

#### The Coordination of Body, Mind, and Intellect

A vibrant body cannot nurture a depressed heart. The coordination of Body, Mind, and Intellect was expressed by Peter Levine as "Three Brains, One Mind." When this coordination is intensely disturbed beyond the capacity for self-regulation, psychological problems appear.

Coordination can be divided into two opposing aspects, synergy and complementarity, and also into two opposing directions, top-down and bottom-up. On a long-term level, the activity levels of Body, Mind, and Intellect remain consistent. However, specific to any given moment, a situation of waxing and waning will repeatedly occur. The moment we capture an unusual breath in the environment, our limbs may freeze, but our brain becomes highly activated (manifesting as the sudden disappearance of large movements and the sudden intensification of micro-activities, activating detailed and comprehensive observation). Then, the limbs become active again, and the brain calms down slightly. This repeats multiple times until returning to a normal state. The degree of instantaneous brain activation reflects the individual's mental resources. If the brain activation is insufficient, the body will struggle to recover vitality from the freeze. Unless appropriate external force intervenes, the individual will continue to appear stunned. This is much like two people playing ping-pong: as long as one side fails to return the ball, the interaction stagnates, and both parties will be stunned in place until someone picks up the ball. In the course of repeated matches, the skill level of both sides will tend to converge.

Somatic Experiencing focuses on mind-body coordination; rebuilding the connection between the body and the intellect is a crucial component of SE. Cognitive therapy focuses on mental coordination; helping the individual establish a life narrative that fully reflects their own subjective reality is a crucial component of cognitive therapy.

#### The Two Dimensions of Traumatization

In the context of this article, "integration" and "differentiation" are two sides of the same coin. "Insufficient integration" and "insufficient differentiation" have essentially the same connotation. The difference is that insufficient integration emphasizes the "fragmented state" caused by trauma, while insufficient differentiation emphasizes the "chaotic state" caused by developmental stagnation. Integration is closely connected differentiation; differentiation is clarified integration. The antonyms for integration and differentiation are splitting and disintegration. The extreme form of splitting and disintegration is dissociative disorder.

The trauma healing process is akin to a team overcoming internal schisms and reforming its cohesion. Integration can be divided into two dimensions: "integration between levels" and "integration within the same level."

Insufficient integration between levels manifests as "having no backbone (lack of subjectivity)." The individual can only experience simple, intense emotions and make simple, crude stress responses; they cannot form delicate, complex feelings and thoughts. They easily interpret socializing as "acting" and "scheming."

Insufficient integration within the same level manifests as "self-conflict," or being "screwed up/twisted" (æ‹§å·´). The individual easily interprets socializing as "gossiping."

The higher the degree of integration within a level (or between levels), the more easily problems of insufficient integration between levels (or within a level) are exposed, and thus the more easily they are corrected in time. On a long-term basis, the degree of integration within levels and the degree of integration between levels remain consistent.

Integration or disintegration between levels can be perceived through changes in the mind-body state. Integration or disintegration within a level can be identified through self-coordination or self-conflict. Social situations (or other high-pressure situations) drive the individual to maintain a higher degree of integration *between* levels; at this time, problems of insufficient integration *within* the same level are easily exposed, while problems of insufficient integration *between* levels are easily concealed. Solitary situations are the opposite. For example, many CPTSD survivors feel completely normal when alone, but the moment they enter a social situation, they fall into sensory overload and feel at a complete loss. Many depressed individuals fall into endless cognitive rumination and exhibit difficulty initiating tasks when alone, yet they feel much better when they are with friends, at which point they will make many positive commitments to themselves. But once they return to solitude, they again fall back into a state of depression from which they cannot extract themselves.

#### Self-Help from the Integration View

From the perspective of inter-subject relations, the process of a survivor's self-rescue is the process of the adult individual using their "Adult Self" to take on the responsibility of the previously absent parent. Under scientific guidance and within social life, they educate the neglected "Child Self," cultivating its capacity for action and self-restraint. From the perspective of the subject-environment relationship, the process of self-rescue is the process of the subject resetting their own primitive impulses. The resetting of impulses is usually accompanied by intense, involuntary trembling.

### The Core of Interaction: Understanding Interaction Loops

Interaction forms "loops." One party initiates an invitation, the other responds, and the response in turn drives the initiator to change their state. Both parties' states rapidly change, mutually causing and affecting one another. Within the constant cycling of the interaction loop, impulses (in this article, "impulse" specifically refers to behavioral impulses), emotions, and concepts continuously emerge, develop, differentiate, and dissolve. The individual's adaptation to and transformation of the stimulus proceeds in sync.

In Raun K. Kaufman's autism home therapy technique (Son-Rise Program), the interaction loop is an important foundational concept. This article uses this concept as its logical starting point. All content in this article should be understood within the context of interaction loops.

Just as "symptom" (discomfort perceived by the subject) and "sign" (abnormalities found by an observer's examination) are different concepts, interaction loops can also be described from two different perspectives.

#### The Subject-Environment Interaction Loop

From the individual's (subject's) own perspective, all activity occurs within the subject-environment interaction loop. All other interaction loops are special cases of this loop. The process of the individual's own development is the process of the interaction between the subject and the environment becoming increasingly rich, and their intermingling becoming increasingly profound. In terms of subjective experience, the interaction loop is the infinite cycle of sensation and behavior. The subject-environment interaction loop can also be understood with the help of the concept of "reafference." The subject-environment interaction loop determines the individual's phenomenological world.

#### The Inter-Subject Interaction Loop

From the perspective of inter-subject relations, all activity occurs within the inter-subject interaction loop. The so-called subject-environment interaction loop is merely an instantaneous snapshot of the inter-subject loop, or perhaps the subject's "self-interaction." Self-interaction, however, is merely the internalization of inter-subject interaction. Internalization implies the accumulation of experience and the formation of habits.

This article does not accept a "God's-eye (omnipotent participant or omniscient observer) view." Even when discussing inter-subject relations, one subject must be chosen as the center of the discussion; otherwise, the narrator becomes the subject within a subject-environment loop. What they are narrating is no longer the story of the observed object, but their own story.

#### Observer and Participant

In the subject-environment interaction loop, the observer and the participant (or "doer") are directly unified. The narrative unfolding around the subject-environment loop is the "self-centric narrative." In the inter-subject interaction loop, the observer and participant are highly differentiated. The subject must possess considerable flexibility, maintain a balance between the two identities, and maintain relatively objective observation while actively participating in the activity.

Because survivors lack interpersonal interaction, their differentiation between these two roles is very low. They only perform well in situations where the two roles are not clearly differentiated (such as solving a math problem). When a life scenario involves the differentiation of the two, they either become pure observers, unable to integrate into the situation, or they degenerate into pure participants, constrained by others at every turn.

Psychological problems can only be fully exposed and resolved within the inter-subject interaction loop. When a subject wants to evade psychological problems, or even glamorize them as a kind of talent, they will often immerse themselves in the self-centric narrative and avoid the inter-subject interaction loop narrative.

The lack of interpersonal interaction means that survivors can only tell stories that satisfy them within the subject-environment narrative framework. They believe they are just objectively stating the story of the object they observed, unaware that this is precisely their own story. They are telling their own story, yet their self is absent from the story. They lack self-awareness regarding their own responsibility and influence.

The concept of observer and participant can be understood with the help of the concepts of "first-order chaos" and "second-order chaos" in Cybernetics.

#### Synchronicity

The subject-environment interaction loop is formed along with the differentiation of behavior and perception; it reflects the synchronicity between motor commands and perceptual feedback. In a newborn infant, the behavioral process, sensory process, and perceptual process are identical. They gradually differentiate, becoming concepts that, to an observer, are interconnected yet distinct. Identity thus becomes synchronicity. Synchronicity means mutual confirmation, mutual adaptation, and mutual blending. This synchronicity makes "me" into "the world's me," and the "world" into "my world." The process of the subject coming to know the world thus becomes the process of coming to know the self; the process of integrating different parts of the self becomes the process of integrating different aspects of the world.

Similarly, the inter-subject interaction loop is formed along with the differentiation of self and other (or "mine" and "not-mine"); it reflects the synchronicity of the two interacting parties. This synchronicity makes "me" into "the me within the relationship," and the "relationship" into "my relationship." The process of the subject establishing their own subjectivity becomes the process of recognizing the subjectivity of the other.

At any moment that the subject is alive, all their activities are proceeding within interaction loops. This is true whether these activities are attended to (conscious) or unattended to (unconscious), whether they are episodic (recallable) or non-episodic (unrecallable). All, and also infinite, interaction loops converge to form a person's stream of experience.

#### Cooperation and Confrontation

In the inter-subject interaction loop, the process of establishing and maintaining interaction is cooperation. Regardless of whether the attitude the subject conveys to the other party is supportive or opposing, as long as the goal is to maintain the interaction, one is affirming the other's sense of existence and influence. We receive the information conveyed by the other party, organize its main points, and then give our opinion. We acknowledge that both parties share the same discursive space (context), grant the other party the qualification of equal dialogue with us, and allow them to influence us. This is cooperation. Conflict is not frightening; conflict is what creates engagement. Only when two parties engage back and forth can they cooperate to produce a perfect drama. In the process of cooperation, both parties are profoundly influenced by each other, gradually taking on the imprint of the other.

In the subject-environment interaction loop, the concepts corresponding to cooperation are "exploration" and "blending."

Activities that hinder or destroy interaction are confrontation. Cooperation has continuity; confrontation has non-sustainability. Just as any achievement cannot be accomplished overnight but can be destroyed in an instant, confrontation will ultimately lead to new cooperation; otherwise, the subject will fall into crisis. The most famous example of confrontation is the non-violent non-cooperation movement organized and led by the Indian revolutionary Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.

Special life experiences make it very difficult for survivors to share the same discursive space with others. The requests they make or the responses they give often deviate from social norms, causing confusion. This involuntary confrontation severely limits their interactive ability. To compensate for the damage they cause to the interaction, they often tend to over-cooperate, which results in them being easily influenced by things they do not like. This causes them great pain. Severe feelings of frustration cause them to increasingly escape reality. Escaping (avoidance) and running away (fleeing) are completely different concepts. Running away is a form of confrontation. Avoidance is neither cooperation nor confrontation; it is the stripping away of one's own social nature. Whether an act is avoidance or fleeing is sometimes not intuitive. It depends, to an extent, on the subject's sense of participation. Fleeing is often accompanied by excitement; avoidance is often accompanied by intense fear or even despair. A person who flees can conduct an effective review (post-mortem) after the fact. A person who avoids often struggles to justify their actions; their cognition exhibits fragmentation or even dissociative characteristics.
